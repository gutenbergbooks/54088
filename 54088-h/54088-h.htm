<h2>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>
<p>Towards the close of the year 1814, a
young naval officer, Lieutenant <i>Chappell</i>,
of his Majesty&rsquo;s ship <i>Rosamond</i>, who had
recently returned, for the second time,
from an expedition to the <i>North-eastern</i>
coast of <i>America</i>, brought to <i>Cambridge</i>
a collection of the dresses, weapons,
&amp;c. of the <i>Indians</i> inhabiting <i>Hudson&rsquo;s
Bay</i><a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>; requesting that I would present
these curiosities to the Public Library
of the University. This Collection so
much resembled another which the
<i>Russian</i> Commodore <i>Billings</i> brought to
Petersburg from the <i>North-western</i> shores
of the same continent, and part of which
<span class="pb" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
Professor <i>Pallas</i> had given to me in the
<i>Crimea</i>, that, being desirous to learn whether
the same customs and language might not
be observed over the whole of <i>North America</i>,
between the parallels 50&deg; and 70&deg; of
north latitude, I proposed to Lieutenant
<i>Chappell</i> a series of questions concerning
the natives of the <i>North-eastern</i> coast;
desiring to have an answer to each of them,
in writing, founded upon his own personal
observations. In consequence of this application,
I was entrusted with a perusal of
the following <i>Journal</i>. It was written by
himself, during his last expedition: and
having since prevailed upon him to make it
public, it is a duty incumbent upon me to
vouch for its authenticity, and to make
known some particulars respecting its
author, which may perhaps give an additional
interest to his Narrative. The Letters,
indeed, which have accompanied his communications
with regard to his late voyage,
<span class="pb" id="Page_v">v</span>
are strongly tinged with the &ldquo;<i>infandum jubes
renovare dolorem</i>;&rdquo; because, to the ardent
spirit of a <i>British</i> seaman, no service can be
more depressing than that which, during
war, banishes him from the career of glory,
to a station where no proof of skill or of
intrepidity, no enterprise of fatigue or of
danger, is ever attended with honour or
reward<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>. Lieutenant <i>Chappell</i> was twice
ordered upon this station; after exploits in
the navy, which, at a very early period
of his life, obtained for him the rank he
now holds.</p>
<p>In 1805, he assisted in cutting out the
<i>Spanish</i> privateer-schooner, <i>Isabella La
Demos</i>, from under the batteries of a small
<span class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
bay in <i>South America</i><a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a>. In 1806, after witnessing
the battle of <i>St. Domingo</i>, he was
with the boats which burned the <i>Imperiale</i> of
120 guns, and the <i>Diomede</i> of eighty guns.
In the latter end of the same year, his ship,
the <i>King&rsquo;s Fisher</i>, having towed <i>Lord
Cochrane</i>&rsquo;s frigate from under the batteries
of <i>L&rsquo;Isle d&rsquo;Aix</i>, near <i>Rochfort</i>, assisted in
the capture of <i>Le President</i> of forty-four
guns. In 1808, he was at the capture of
the <i>Danish</i> islands, <i>St. Thomas</i> and <i>St. Croix</i>,
in the <i>West Indies</i>. In 1808, or 1809, he
was in the <i>Intrepid</i> of sixty-four guns,
when she engaged two <i>French</i> frigates, and
was very severely handled. Afterwards,
he was at the capture of the <i>Saints</i>, and of
<span class="pb" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
the Island of <i>Martinico</i>, when he was employed
on the shore, in fighting the <i>breaching</i>
batteries. In 1810, he commanded a gun-boat
during the siege of <i>Cadiz</i>. The conduct
of the gun-boats upon this occasion
requires no comment: it was then that he
received a severe wound in the thigh, and
was made Lieutenant. In 1812, he assisted
in landing the Expedition, under General
<i>Maitland</i>, in <i>Murcia</i>. In 1813, he was
employed in protecting the fisheries upon
the coast of <i>Labrador</i>. In 1814, he made
the voyage to <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>, whereof the
following pages contain his unaltered Narrative.
In 1815, being First Lieutenant of
his Majesty&rsquo;s ship <i>Leven</i>, he was employed
in assisting the Chiefs of <i>La Vendee</i>, and
in reinstating the Prince <i>Tremouille</i> in the
Captain-generalship of the Department <i>de
Cotes d&rsquo;Or</i>.</p>
<p>Such have been the services of this
<span class="pb" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
meritorious officer, now only twenty-five
years of age; but, owing to the termination
of the war, dismissed, with many other
of his gallant comrades, from the active
duties in which they were engaged.
These circumstances, as it must be obvious,
are by no means querulously introduced:
nor is the following Narrative made public
with the slightest intention of reproaching
the <i>Admiralty</i> with the hard lot to which
one of its naval heroes was exposed, in being
twice employed in such a service:&mdash;it is a
lot that must fall somewhere; and the
present Publication will shew, that the
person upon whom it devolved is able to
give a satisfactory account of the manner in
which this part of his duty was performed.</p>

<h2 id="c2">NARRATIVE,
<br /><span class="small">&amp;c. &amp;c.</span></h2>
<p>On the 14th day of <i>May</i>, 1814, Captain
<i>Campbell</i> received orders to repair, without
delay, to <i>Hoseley Bay</i>, on the coast of
<i>Suffolk</i>; and there to wait for his final
directions from the Admiralty.</p>
<p>The <i>Rosamond</i>, at this time, had been
lying about a fortnight at <i>Spithead</i>,
perfectly ready for sea; and it was conjectured
that <i>America</i> would have been
the place of her destination: of course,
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
many among us were big with the hopes
of fame, and many with the expectation
of fortune. When the above-mentioned
orders arrived, however, all chance of our
proceeding to the seat of war appeared
at an end: yet we consoled ourselves with
the reflection, that we should doubtless
be employed on the coast of <i>Norway</i>; as
the whole of that kingdom had been
declared in a state of blockade, in consequence
of the <i>Norwegians</i> refusing to
accede to the Treaty of <i>Keil</i>, by which
their country was to be annexed for ever
to the dominion of <i>Sweden</i>. Accordingly,
we sailed from <i>Spithead</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">May</span> <i>15th</i>.&mdash;We had light winds all
this day. As we passed out of <i>Spithead</i>,
through <i>St. Helen&rsquo;s</i>, we observed His
Majesty&rsquo;s ship <i>Adamant</i>, and an <i>East-India</i>
ship, going in. About nine in the evening:
we passed close to the <i>Owers Light</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p><span class="sc">May</span> <i>16th</i>.&mdash;In the forenoon, fine calm
weather, we came to an anchor in sight of
<i>Brighton</i>, to wait the change of tide:
saw His Majesty&rsquo;s ship <i>Hope</i> at anchor
in the <i>Roads</i>. In the afternoon, got under
weigh: observed His Majesty&rsquo;s brig <i>Tigress</i>
standing down <i>Channel</i>. Towards nightfall,
we weathered the promontory of
<i>Beachy Head</i>, and passed in view of
<i>Hastings</i>, where the famous battle was
fought between <i>King Harold</i> and <i>William
the Conqueror</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">May</span> <i>17th</i>.&mdash;At two in the morning,
anchored in sight of <i>Dungeness</i> Light-house.
At seven <span class="small">A.M.</span> weighed, with a foul
wind, and beat towards the <i>South Foreland</i>.
Came in sight of the coast of <i>France</i>:
observed a large pillar, or monument, on
the hills above <i>Boulogne</i>, said to have
been erected by <i>Buonaparte</i>. In the afternoon,
anchored off the town of <i>Folkestone</i>.
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
Towards evening, weighed again; and, after
night-fall, anchored in <i>Dover Roads</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">May</span> <i>18th</i>.&mdash;In the morning we had a
fine view of <i>Dover Castle</i>, the majestic
<i>South Foreland</i>, &amp;c. Got under weigh,
and stood across the <i>Channel</i>;&mdash;observed
many vessels passing between <i>France</i> and
<i>England</i>. Saw the spires of <i>Calais</i>. Beat
up at the back of the <i>Goodwin Sands</i>;&mdash;observed
a three-decked ship in the <i>Downs</i>,
hoisting the flag of his Royal Highness
the <i>Duke of Clarence</i>, under a general
salute of cannon from all the shipping.
Towards evening, anchored in sight of
<i>Margate</i>; but after night-fall, got under
weigh again.</p>
<p><span class="sc">May</span> <i>19th</i>.&mdash;In the morning, anchored
again, near a shoal called the <i>Galloper</i>. In
the forenoon, weighed. Towards evening,
passed <i>Orford-Ness</i> Light-houses, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
anchored in <i>Hoseley Bay</i>. An officer was
immediately sent on shore, to bring on board
the final orders. The boat was nearly
overturned in landing, in consequence of
the heavy surf on all parts of this coast:
however, the officer returned about midnight,
and delivered the orders to the
Captain. Nothing could exceed the consternation
and astonishment of every person
on board, to find we were directed to
proceed, almost immediately, for <i>Hudson&rsquo;s
Bay</i>!&mdash;Had we been ordered to the <i>North
Pole</i>, there could not have been more
long faces among us. Down fell, at once,
all the <i>a&euml;rial castles</i> which we had been
so long building; and nothing remained,
but the dismal prospect of a tedious
voyage, amidst icy seas, and shores covered
with eternal snows.</p>
<p><span class="sc">May</span> <i>20th</i>.&mdash;A boat was this day despatched
to <i>Harwich</i>, from which place we
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
were about ten miles distant, to get on board
what few naval stores were wanted to complete
us for the voyage. <i>Harwich</i> is a small
town, with narrow streets, not paved:
there are some pleasant walks in the
environs. The harbour is a good one, with
sufficient depth of water for a frigate.
The place is well fortified towards the sea,
and has a small naval arsenal. A guard-ship
is generally stationed at this port,
during war.</p>
<p><span class="sc">May</span> <i>21st</i>.&mdash;In the morning, His Majesty&rsquo;s
ship <i>Unicorn</i> passed us, under an
immense press of sail, with a Royal
standard flying at her mast-head, which
we saluted with twenty-one guns.</p>
<p><span class="sc">May</span> <i>22d</i>.&mdash;Towards the evening of this
day, our Captain received orders to proceed
to the <i>Nore</i>, in order to procure pilots to
conduct the ship safe to the <i>Orkneys</i>. We had
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
also another motive in visiting the <i>Nore</i> at
this time, which I may, perhaps, be excused
relating, although it have no immediate
connexion with the voyage that we were
about to undertake. Previous to our sailing
from <i>Spithead</i>, a shipwright belonging to
the dock-yard had been accidentally killed,
by our having fired a signal-gun without
taking out the shot. Unfortunately, the
poor man&rsquo;s wife, at the moment of his
death, was pregnant of her tenth child.
A subscription was instantly opened for
her, on board our ship, and &pound;.60 was
the next day paid into her hands. I have
since been informed, that the different ships
at <i>Spithead</i> followed our example, as did
also the workmen of the Dock-yard; and a
handsome sum was collected in the whole.
No blame could be attributed to any person;
but, to prevent the possibility of such an imputation,
it was thought necessary that the
gunner should be tried by a court-martial;
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
and it was to assemble this court, that we
were now ordered to proceed to the <i>Nore</i><a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">May</span> <i>23d</i>.&mdash;In the morning, we weighed,
with a strong breeze in our favour; and
at noon anchored at the <i>Great Nore</i>;&mdash;observed
a <i>Russian</i> Vice-admiral, with a
squadron belonging to that nation, at anchor
there also. We remained at this place,
waiting the arrival of the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i>
traders, until the 30th; when the two ships
arrived; accompanied by a brig belonging
to the <i>Moravian Missionary Society</i>, bound
for the coast of <i>Labrador</i>, whither she was
to proceed under our protection, or at
least as far as our courses lay together. It
is a rule with the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay Company</i>,
to make their ships always <i>break ground</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
on the 29th of <i>May</i>; although, sometimes,
they do not leave the river <i>Thames</i> before
<i>June</i>. The same day on which the
<i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i> ships arrived at the <i>Nore</i>,
we were joined by a new Captain (<i>Stopford</i>);
our former one (<i>Campbell</i>) not wishing, for
many reasons, to go the voyage. His loss
was most sincerely regretted by all of us:
however, our new Commander proved himself,
during the whole time we sailed
together, to be one of the most exemplary
captains in His Majesty&rsquo;s navy. We continued
getting our stores on board until&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="sc">June</span> <i>4th</i>.&mdash;Early this day, we weighed
anchor. Being the birth-day of our venerable
King, all the <i>English</i> and <i>Russian</i>
ships of war were dressed with flags, and
made a very gay appearance.</p>
<p><span class="sc">June</span> <i>5th</i>.&mdash;We anchored twice this day,
to wait the change of tide: at first, off the
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
<i>Gunfleet Sand</i>; and towards evening we
brought up, off <i>Harwich</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">June</span> <i>6th</i>.&mdash;In the morning, weighed,
and beat up into <i>Hoseley Bay</i>;&mdash;found lying
there His Majesty&rsquo;s ship <i>Bristol</i>. Towards
evening, sent the purser on shore, to
procure fresh beef.</p>
<p><span class="sc">June</span> <i>7th</i>.&mdash;The boat returned in the
morning, with the purser in sad distress;
eight men having deserted from the boat,
from an antipathy to the voyage.</p>
<p><span class="sc">June</span> <i>8th</i>.&mdash;A party of soldiers, and an
officer, were sent to look for the deserters;
but in the evening they returned, unsuccessful.</p>
<p><span class="sc">June</span> <i>9th</i>.&mdash;In the afternoon, weighed with
our convoy, and beat towards <i>Yarmouth</i>.
In the evening, anchored off <i>Aldborough</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p><span class="sc">June</span> <i>10th</i>.&mdash;In the morning, we again
weighed. At noon, anchored at <i>Yarmouth</i>;
and sent a boat on shore, to procure beef
and vegetables for the ship&rsquo;s company; as
this was the last place we touched at, in
<i>England</i>. <i>Yarmouth</i> is a large straggling
place; consisting of one or two good streets,
and many narrow lanes; with open spaces
here and there, like squares. The church has
a most beautiful spire. The town does not
contain any magnificent buildings: here is,
however, a very fine market-place; and
an agreeable promenade, under the shade of
two rows of trees, running along the quay
on the banks of the river <i>Wensum</i>, on the
<span class="small">N. W.</span> side of the town. All the soil around
the town is barren; which accounts
for the waste of room in the buildings,
as land is of little or no value. I know
not any place in <i>Great Britain</i> which has
finer bathing conveniences. In the evening,
we again weighed; and at night-fall
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
passed by <i>Haseborough</i> and <i>Cromer</i> Light-houses.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">June</span> <i>11th</i>.&mdash;In the morning, we saw the
<i>Spurn</i> Light-house; and towards noon, we
passed by <i>Flamborough Head</i>, in <i>Yorkshire</i>.
Towards evening, we had a fine view of
<i>Scarborough</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">June</span> <i>12th</i>.&mdash;A beautiful day, running with
a fair wind and smooth sea. In the evening,
saw the blue tops of the <i>Cheviot Hills</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">June</span> <i>13th</i>.&mdash;A fine fair breeze. Towards
noon, passed the <i>Buchan Ness</i>, and had a
good view of <i>Peterhead</i>. Towards evening
the wind increased to a gale;&mdash;hove-to,
until morning.</p>
<p><span class="sc">June</span> <i>14th</i>.&mdash;In the morning, passed the
<i>Pentland Frith</i>, in which the tide is like a
whirlpool; and, after having run by <i>Long-Hope</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
Harbour, we anchored at <i>Stromness</i>,
in the Island of <i>Pomona</i>, the principal of
the <i>Orkneys</i>; immediately opposite to which
is the <i>Isle of Hoy</i>, having on it a remarkable
high mountain, in shape very like the
Rock of <i>Gibraltar</i>. Immediately on our
arrival, the two <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i> ships fired
seven guns each, to give notice to the
inhabitants of their arrival. The visits of
the <i>North-west men</i>, as the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i>
ships are denominated, creates a sort of
annual mart, or fair, in the <i>Orkneys</i>; as
it is from hence that they derive all the
necessary supplies of poultry, beef, vegetables,
and even men, to fit them for so
long a voyage:&mdash;consequently, the <i>Orkney</i>
people listen with anxiety for this salute
of cannon, which announces the arrival
of the <span class="small">N. W.</span> ships; as almost every person
in the island is, in some way or other,
interested in their coming.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p><span class="sc">June</span> <i>15th</i>.&mdash;We were employed in watering
the ship; and found it difficult to
procure a sufficient quantity, owing to
a great drought which had lately prevailed.</p>
<p>The town of <span class="sc">Stromness</span> is an irregular
assemblage of dirty huts, with here and
there a decent house. There is scarcely
any thing deserving the name of a street
in the place, although it is said to contain
a population of two thousand souls. A
few years ago it did not contain above one
third of that number. The harbour is small,
but very secure: it is defended from the sea
by an island called <i>The Holmes</i>; and there
is a good summer roadstead outside the
island, called the <i>Back of the Holmes</i>. Firewood
cannot be procured in the <i>Orkneys</i>,
where there are no trees; but <i>Newcastle</i>
coal is always remarkably cheap. About
six miles from <i>Stromness</i> is a large lake,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
called <i>Stonehouse Loch</i>, in consequence of
some high flat stones which stand by the side
of it, something similar in appearance to
<i>Stonehenge</i>, on <i>Salisbury Plain</i>: they bear
no inscription, and seem to have been set
on their ends in the same state as when
taken from the quarry<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a>:&mdash;the view given
of them in <i>Barrie&rsquo;s</i> Description of the
<i>Orkney Islands</i> is perfectly correct. The
quantities of grouse, partridge, plover,
snipe, &amp;c. in the <i>Orkneys</i>, is astonishing:
neither foxes nor hares are to be found;
but rabbits are very numerous. There
are some spots of good land in the valleys;
but in such a bad state of cultivation, from
idleness and want of manure, that at least
five weeds are produced to one blade of
corn. Wheat is not grown in any of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
islands; the produce consisting, principally,
in barley and oats. But the chief
export of the <i>Orkneys</i> is kelp, ashes obtained
by the burning of sea-weed<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a>, with
which all the shores abound: this proves
a most valuable acquisition to those gentlemen
whose estates border on the sea;
as it sells, on an average, at &pound;.11 a ton;
and is collected, at low water, without
much difficulty. The kelp estates produce
triennial harvests; and when this commodity
is gathered, it is sent either to
<i>Newcastle</i>, to <i>Dumbarton</i>, or to <i>Leith</i>;
great quantities being required for the
use of the glass-houses established in
those towns. The number of tame geese
reared in these islands is really surprising:
they wander about the barren hills in
flocks, like sheep; and the owners give
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
themselves little or no trouble about them,
until they are wanted for sale, or for their
own consumption.</p>
<p><span class="sc">June</span> <i>16th</i>.&mdash;I accompanied some of
the officers on a shooting party. This
circumstance is merely mentioned to introduce
a description of the farm-houses;
as we visited many of them during our
excursion. The delineation of <i>one</i> will
answer for <i>all</i>: and surely there never was
a scene better fitted for the pencil of a
<i>Morland</i>! In one corner stood a calf; in
another, a sheep and its lambkin; in the
next, walled in with loose stones, a piece of
sail-cloth served as a bed for the family; and
the fourth corner, as also the sides and roof
of the building, were garnished with decayed
farming implements. The centre of
the habitation was occupied by a turf fire,
before which some oaten cakes were roasting;
and, in the middle of the roof, a large
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
square hole was cut, to allow the smoke
to escape. By the side of the fire, in a
large and remarkably high rush chair, sat an
old woman, with a spinning-wheel before
her, endeavouring to still the cries of a
very dirty infant that lay in her lap. There
was also another apartment to the hut, for
the accommodation of the cows, of which
they had a considerable number. The two
rooms were not even divided by a door
from each other, and the bare earth was
the only flooring of either.</p>
<p>During this day we were still employed
in getting water on board, although it is
rather difficult to be procured.</p>
<p><span class="sc">June</span> <i>17th</i>.&mdash;Our carpenters were busily
employed in affixing ring-bolts to the
rudder; from which strong iron chains
were brought in at the quarter ports of the
ship, in order to secure the rudder against
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
the shocks of the drift ice; as we were well
aware that we should have to force our
way through large quantities of it, in
passing <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Straits</i>: and we afterwards
found this to have been a most necessary
precaution. We likewise borrowed
from the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i> ships the necessary
store of ice-anchors, ice-axes, and ice-poles;
neither of those articles having
been supplied by the Admiralty, probably
from not knowing that they would be
requisite.</p>
<p><span class="sc">June</span> <i>18th</i>.&mdash;During the whole of the
time that we remained at <i>Orkney</i> after this
day, we were busily employed in getting
all kinds of necessaries on board.</p>
<p><span class="sc">June</span> <i>29th</i>.&mdash;We sailed from <i>Orkney</i>, at
8 <span class="small">A.M.</span> with the two <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i> ships, and
the <i>Moravian</i> Missionary brig, in company.
Towards evening it blew a fresh breeze,
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
and the wind veered round against us. At
sunset we had a distant view of the
<i>Caithness Hills</i> and the <i>Isle of Shetland</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">June</span> <i>30th</i>.&mdash;There being a very heavy sea,
with rain at times, during this day, we did
not perceive any alteration in the climate.
The wind still proving foul, we continued
to stand to the northward. In the evening,
after some very violent squalls and heavy
showers of rain, the wind suddenly veered
to the <span class="small">N. W.</span> and reduced us to close-reefed
topsails, blowing very hard. During the
night we stood to the <span class="small">S. W.</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>1st</i>.&mdash;In the early part of the day
the gale abated by degrees, and towards
evening we had fine sunny weather. Wind
still in the <span class="small">N. W.</span> quarter; consequently we
have made way to the <span class="small">S. W.</span> since yesterday,
about 67 miles. Latitude at noon this day,
59&deg;. 10&prime;. <span class="small">N.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>2d</i>.&mdash;In the morning, we saw the
<i>Lewis Islands</i>; and the wind chopping round
to <span class="small">S. W.</span> we tacked, and stood off shore to
the <span class="small">N. W.</span> At noon, as the wind continued
to blow steady in the <span class="small">S. S. W.</span>, we steered
<span class="small">W. N. W.</span> Many Solan geese flying about:
these are nearly the size of a tame goose,
but the neck much shorter, and the wings
longer, tipped with black; all the rest
of their plumage being perfectly white. At
night-fall, the weather misty, but not cold.</p>
<p>On taking our last departure from
the land this morning, it is necessary to
observe, that, in my narrative of the voyage,
I shall merely state, on each day, the
course and distance run by the ship in the
preceding day, without making a dull account
of latitude, longitude, bearings and
distances, allowances for lee-way, currents,
&amp;c. &amp;c.; as all this farrago of nautical calculation,
however necessary it may be to
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
mariners, cannot fail to tire out the patience
of a general reader; and the object of this
publication, is not so much to point out
the track of the <i>Rosamond</i>, in her voyage
to <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>, as to describe the manners
and customs of the different tribes
inhabiting the shores of that immense gulf.</p>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>3d</i>.&mdash;Course run, <span class="small">W.</span> by <span class="small">N.</span> 66 miles.
Thick, foggy weather. During the morning
we frequently lost sight of our convoy, but
saw them again on its clearing up. Light
winds from the <span class="small">S. W.</span> Ship standing to the
north. Observed great quantities of a peculiar
kind of sea-weed, in the shape of stars.
Numberless sea-birds round the ship, particularly
Solan geese.</p>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>4th</i>.&mdash;Course run, <span class="small">W.</span> by <span class="small">S.</span> &frac12; S. 79 miles.
In the middle of the night we had a fair wind,
which held during the day, accompanied
by a thick fog; ship going generally about
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
five miles an hour. Perhaps it is deserving
notice, that, since our departure from
<i>Orkney</i>, we never had a night so dark as
not to be able to read and write.</p>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>5th</i>.&mdash;Course run, <span class="small">W.</span> by <span class="small">N.</span> &frac14; <span class="small">N.</span> 101
miles.
During the night, lost our fair wind, and
got a westerly breeze, with sunny weather.
Towards noon, the wind again veered to the
<span class="small">S. W.</span> This day we obtained an observation of
the sun, for the first time since our leaving
<i>Orkney</i>, and found ourselves in latitude
59&deg;. 8&prime;. <span class="small">N.</span> We saw neither Solan geese
nor sea-weed.</p>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>6th</i>.&mdash;Course run, <span class="small">W.</span> by <span class="small">S.</span> &frac12; <span class="small">S.</span> 90

A fair wind all day, variable from <span class="small">N. E.</span>
to <span class="small">S. E.</span>, ship steering <span class="small">W. N. W.</span> at about four
miles an hour. Noticed the air to be getting
much colder, probably occasioned by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
wind shifting to the <span class="small">N. E.</span> The sea-birds
and weed appeared now to have taken their
final leave of us; which certainly agrees
with the great Cook&rsquo;s opinion, that when
met with in vast numbers, they are a certain
indication of the proximity of land. In
the evening, we saw a large <i>finner</i> or two.
Ship going about seven miles an hour.</p>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>7th</i>.&mdash;Course run, <span class="small">W.</span> &frac34; <span class="small">S.</span> 121 miles.
In the middle of the night, we lost our fair
wind. Early in the morning, saw a strange
vessel to windward, and made all sail after
her: continued in pursuit the whole day,
with light winds, varying from North to
East. Every person on board was highly
elated with the thoughts of a prize. All
notion of the strange vessel&rsquo;s being a
friend was scouted; and it was carried
<i>nem. con.</i> that she could be no other than a
rich <i>American</i> from <i>Archangel</i>, homeward
bound.</p>

At one <span class="small">A.M.</span> spoke the vessel that we were
in pursuit of. She was a light brig from
<i>Copenhagen</i>, bound to <i>Davis&rsquo; Straits</i>,
where the <i>Danes</i> have some settlements.
Early in the morning we rejoined our
convoy, and shortly afterwards perceived
another brig to windward: we immediately
made all sail in pursuit of her, but soon
relinquished the chase, as we were apprehensive
it might lead us too far from our
convoy. Wind about <span class="small">N.</span> by <span class="small">W.</span> Ship standing
to the westward. No birds to be seen, excepting
one or two solitary sea-gulls, which
are to be met with at any distance from
the land.</p>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>9th</i>.&mdash;Course run, <span class="small">S. W.</span> &frac34; <span class="small">W.</span> 107 miles.
A gloomy day. Wind blowing fresh
from the North. Towards evening, the
wind abated; and it fell calm, which continued
through the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>10th</i>.&mdash;Course run, <span class="small">S. W.</span> by
<span class="small">W.</span> &frac34; <span class="small">W.</span> 36 miles.
At 2 <span class="small">A.M.</span> the ship was so surrounded
by myriads of porpoises, that it appeared as
if they had some intention of taking us by
<i>storm</i>. It is an opinion of the sailors, that
those fish generally precede a smart gale,
and make towards the point whence the
wind will arise. These swarms were proceeding
in a North-east direction. During
the fore-part of the day we had light variable
winds from the southward; and at noon
were taken aback, with a stiff gale from
the <span class="small">N. N. W.</span>: it continued to blow hard in
squalls.</p>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>11th</i>.&mdash;Course run, <span class="small">S. W.</span> 32 miles.
During this day, the wind blew a pleasant
breeze from the <span class="small">N. W.</span> At 10 <span class="small">A.M.</span> we put
about ship, and stood to the North. It is
worthy of remark, that the sky had been
so continually overcast, since we quitted
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
the <i>Orkneys</i>, that we had been only able to
procure the meridian altitude of the sun
twice. Thus we had been twelve days
already on our voyage, with only two good
observations. It ought also to be mentioned,
that we found ourselves much retarded
by the bad sailing of the <i>North-west</i>
ships; but the <i>Moravian</i> brig sailed very
well.</p>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>12th</i>.&mdash;Course run, <span class="small">N. W.</span> by <span class="small">W.</span> 62 miles.
It blew strong all night; but we had a
fine day; and towards noon, the wind shifted
round, and blew fair at South. We got a
peep at the sun this day, and found we
were in latitude 57&deg;. 15&prime;. <span class="small">N.</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>13th</i>.&mdash;Course run, <span class="small">W.</span> &frac12; <span class="small">N.</span> 76 miles.
In the morning, the wind changed to
<span class="small">N.</span> by <span class="small">E.</span> and blew a moderate breeze. After
night-fall we had a faint appearance of
the <i>Aurora Borealis</i>, in the shape of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
<i>rainbow</i>, which rendered it peculiarly interesting.</p>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>14th</i>.&mdash;Course run, <span class="small">S. W.</span> by <span class="small">S.</span> 71 miles.
At 9 <span class="small">A.M.</span> we tacked about; and the
wind coming fair, we steered <span class="small">N. W.</span> by <span class="small">N.</span>
Our ship this forenoon was completely surrounded
by innumerable flights of sea-gulls.
I should imagine that they had been attracted
hither by some unusual assemblage
of fish, as they were all busily employed
in attacks on the finny tribe.</p>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>15th</i>.&mdash;Course run, <span class="small">W.</span> by <span class="small">N.</span> 106 miles.
This morning we were going five miles an
hour, with a fair breeze and thick weather.
It is to be observed, that, with a wind from
the South-east or East, we have always had
a fog; and I have also noticed this to be
the case as far to the southward as the Banks
of <i>Newfoundland</i>; although I am utterly
incapable to account for it satisfactorily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Since our departure from <i>Stromness</i>, the
variation of the compass had been gradually
increasing. We this day allowed for a
difference of four points westerly, between
the magnetic and the true needle; whereas
at <i>Orkney</i> there is only a difference of two
points and a half, or 28 degrees. Thus
it continued increasing until we arrived
within about 300 miles of the settlements
in <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>; when it decreases much
more suddenly; falling away, in that short
distance, to half a point, or five degrees,
West&mdash;this being the ascertained variation
at <i>York Factory</i>. I should think that no
subject could exhibit to an inquisitive mind
a more astonishing matter of inquiry, than
the singular phenomenon which I have just
noticed. Can any thing be more surprising,
than that the variation should increase but
eighteen degrees, in a run of upwards of 2000
miles to the westward; and that it should
then begin to turn; and, in the short run of
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
300 miles on the same course, that it should
suddenly decrease 41 degrees? An officer
belonging to one of the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i> ships
attempted to account for this astonishing
attraction of the needle, by supposing the
contiguity of metallic mountains; but he
could state no facts in support of his hypothesis:
and, although the interior of the
<span class="small">N. W.</span> part of <i>America</i> has doubtless been
explored, and is even actually colonized,
owing to the enterprising spirit of a <i>Selkirk</i>,
yet I cannot learn that any metallic mountains
have been discovered, with a sufficient
profusion of ore to cause such an aberration
in the compass, and at so great a distance<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a>.</p>
<p>Our latitude this day was 56&deg;. 35&prime;. <span class="small">N.</span>;
longitude 38&deg;. <span class="small">W.</span> Towards noon, our fair
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
breeze died away, and we had light
winds from the westward: in the evening,
we exercised the men with the great guns,
in firing at a cask in the water.</p>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>16th</i>.&mdash;Course run, <span class="small">N. W.</span> &frac14; <span class="small">N.</span> 35 miles.
Light winds and vexatious calms all this
day. We now considered ourselves to be
distant from the entrance of <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Straits</i>
about 840 miles. I know not what reason
could have induced the first discoverers of
the northern regions to give such intimidating
names to all the most conspicuous
capes, promontories, bays, creeks, &amp;c.; unless
they were originally bestowed with a
view of preventing others from visiting those
countries; and at the same time to enhance
the public opinion of their own courage:&mdash;for
instance, we passed, in our voyage to
<i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>, <i>Capes Resolution</i>, <i>Comfort</i>,
<i>Farewell</i>, <i>Discord</i>, and <i>Desolation</i>; also, <i>Icy</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
and <i>Bear Coves</i>, and the <i>Islands of God&rsquo;s
Mercies</i>.</p>
<p>The ship was now continually surrounded
by a species of sea-gull, which, on the water,
looked very much like wild-ducks. Those
birds appear to be spread in great multitudes
quite across the mouth of <i>Davis&rsquo; Straits</i>,
from <i>Cape Farewell</i> in <i>Greenland</i> to the
coast of <i>Labrador</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>17th</i>.&mdash;Course run, <span class="small">W.</span> by <span class="small">N.</span> &frac14; <span class="small">N.</span> 20
miles.
The light variable winds still continued
through this day.</p>
<p>Towards evening we were highly entertained
with a combat between a whale and
two or three of that species of fish called
<i>Finners</i>. The fury with which they engage
is surprising. The whale, slowly lifting up
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
his enormous tail, lets it suddenly fall on
his opponents with a most tremendous
crash; thereby throwing up foam to an
amazing height. Although the Finners
have incomparably the advantage in agility,
yet in size and strength they fall but little
short of the smaller whales. The Finners
derive their name from an immense fin,
which they use with great effect in their
attacks on the whale. Sometimes they lift
up this enormous fin, and let it fall upon
their antagonist, in the manner of a thresher&rsquo;s
flail; at other times, they run their whole
body perpendicularly out of the water, exhibiting
a beautiful view of their snow-white
bellies. In this position they have
the singular power of turning round; and
thus they contrive to fall sideways on the
whale, with a shock that may be heard at a
considerable distance.</p>
<p>The sea was this day covered with an
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
oily appearance; and some old <i>Greenland</i>
fishermen, who were on board the ship, gave
a marvellous account of its being occasioned
by the sperm of the whale.</p>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>18th</i>.&mdash;Course run <span class="small">W.</span> &frac34; <span class="small">N.</span> 65 miles.
Early in the morning we had a fine breeze
from the <span class="small">N. E.</span> Latitude at noon, by an
observation of the sun, 57&deg;. 24&prime;. <span class="small">N.</span>; longitude,
by our account, 41&deg;. 17&prime;. <span class="small">W.</span> According
to some charts, we considered ourselves this
day to be in the longitude of <i>Cape Farewell</i>
in <i>Greenland</i>. Nothing can exceed the
uncertainty that prevails, in almost every
chart and book of navigation, respecting
the longitude of the Cape in question.
In proof of this, I shall quote an
extract from the accompanying Memoir
to Mr. <i>Purdy&rsquo;s</i> Chart of the <i>Atlantic</i>:&mdash;&ldquo;Both
the Requisite Tables, and <i>Connaissance
de Tems</i>, state the latitude of <i>Cape
Farewell</i> at 59&deg;. 38&prime;. <span class="small">N.</span>, and longitude, <i>per</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
chronometer, at 42&deg;. 42&prime;. <span class="small">W.</span>; but the <i>Danish</i>
charts place the Cape <i>two degrees</i> more
to the West. We know not which is
right, or if either; and have, <i>doubtingly</i>,
placed it in 43&deg;. 40&prime;. <span class="small">W.</span> as a mean between
the two. This is a point on which further
information is particularly required. The
old books and charts place it from 44&deg;. 30&prime;.
to 44&deg;. 45&prime;. <span class="small">W.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing can be a more serious inconvenience
to mariners than this uncertainty
respecting the latitude and longitude of
places; and it is scarcely to be credited,
that so little pains have been taken to
ascertain the longitude of <i>Greenland&rsquo;s</i>
southernmost extremity.</p>
<p>We experienced sharp cold this day,
and ascribed it to the winds having blown
over the mountains of <i>Greenland</i>, on their
way towards us. As the next three days
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
furnished no remarks worthy an insertion
in this narrative, I shall barely notice the
course and distance run by the ship on each
day; and the reader may thus pass on to
the <i>22d</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>19th</i>.&mdash;Course run <span class="small">S. W.</span> by <span class="small">W.</span> &frac34; <span class="small">W.</span>

<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>21st</i>.&mdash;Course run <span class="small">W.</span> 67 miles.</p>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>22d</i>.&mdash;Course run <span class="small">N. W.</span> &frac12; <span class="small">N.</span> 47
miles. As an indication of our drawing
near to some land, we this morning picked
up a broken tree, about eighteen feet long,
of the yellow pine species. Although we
could not have been less than three hundred
miles from the nearest land, it certainly
had not been long in the water. After
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
night-fall, we were gratified with a most
brilliant display of the <i>Aurora Borealis</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>23d</i>.&mdash;Course run, <span class="small">N. N. W.</span> &frac34; <span class="small">W.</span> 23
miles.
Early in the morning we saw five <i>Greenland</i>
ships, returning to <i>England</i> from the
whale-fishery; and shortly afterwards we
perceived two ships of war, in the <span class="small">N. W.</span>
quarter. At noon we spoke with His Majesty&rsquo;s
ships the <i>Victorious</i> and <i>Horatio</i>.
They had been to <i>Davis&rsquo; Straits</i>, for the
purpose of protecting the whale-fishery; and
the former vessel exhibited a melancholy
proof of the ill effects likely to result from
the extreme state of ignorance in which our
best navigators are placed, relative to the
exact situation of the Northern lands. The
<i>Victorious</i> had struck on a rock, in latitude
66&deg;. 21&prime;. <span class="small">N.</span>, longitude 53&deg;. 47&prime;. <span class="small">W.</span>; entirely
owing to the coast of <i>Greenland</i> having
been laid down <i>four degrees</i> wrong in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
<i>Admiralty Charts</i>. The consequences likely
to result from the loss of a seventy-four-gun
ship, in such a situation, may be easily
imagined; allowing every man to have been
safely conveyed on board the <i>Horatio</i>. The
frigate must herself have been short of
provisions at the moment; and in what possible
way could the captain have provided
for the subsistence of nearly six hundred
people in addition to his own ship&rsquo;s company,
in a part of the world where he could
not have formed the most distant hope of
receiving a supply?&mdash;Fortunately, they were
not destined to experience the horrors of
so dreadful a situation; the <i>Victorious</i> was
got off the rock again, without much difficulty:
yet that her danger had been imminent
cannot be doubted, as she was
obliged to get a topsail under her bottom;
and at the time when we met with her,
there were some apprehensions that she
might not reach <i>England</i> in safety; the
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
leak being so bad, that the crew were compelled
to labour incessantly at the pumps.
The <i>Horatio</i> of course remained with her
until she reached a <i>British</i> port.</p>
<p>After all that has been said respecting
the erroneous state of even the <i>Admiralty
Charts</i> for the Northern Seas, yet I do not
imagine that the smallest imputation of
neglect can be charged to Government
upon that account. It has never yet been
thought an object of sufficient national
importance, to warrant an expenditure of
the public money towards defraying the
great expense that must necessarily be incurred
in surveying thoroughly those frozen
coasts which border upon <i>Davis&rsquo;</i> and
<i>Hudson&rsquo;s Straits</i>. The <i>Greenland</i> mariners
are notorious for paying so little regard to
the situation of the places they visit, that
they are incapable of giving any correct information:
and the officers of the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
ships have a motive in concealing
the knowledge which they actually possess:
this I shall notice more fully hereafter.</p>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>24th</i>.&mdash;Course run, <span class="small">N. W.</span> &frac12; <span class="small">W.</span> 34
miles.
This morning some slight indication appeared
of a lasting fair wind. The fine
mild weather that had prevailed for the last
fortnight was far from affording satisfaction
to the commanders of the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i>
ships; as they prognosticated much
more difficulty in getting through <i>Hudson&rsquo;s
Straits</i>, the natural consequence of so much
calm weather. It would have pleased them
better to have encountered a few gales of
wind, even if they had proved foul; as it
requires strong winds to carry the drift ice
out of the <i>Straits</i>, which is very likely
otherwise to choke the passage. Entering
<i>Hudson&rsquo;s Straits</i>, it is a necessary precaution
to keep close in with the northern shore;
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
as the currents out of <i>Hudson&rsquo;s</i> and <i>Davis&rsquo;
Straits</i> meet on the south side of the entrance,
and carry the ice with great velocity
to the southward, along the coast of
<i>Labrador</i>. We had seen, lately, a number of
the kind of birds called, by the sailors,
<i>Boatswains</i>: they are so numerous to the
southward of the Tropic of <i>Cancer</i>, that they
are called <i>Tropic Birds</i>. I cannot say whether
they are accustomed to seat themselves upon
the water or not; because our visitors flew
at a great height over the ship, and we could
plainly hear their melancholy screams by
night as well as by day. Some amongst
them have long feathers, like spikes, projecting
from their tails; whilst others in the
same flock, and evidently of the same
species, are without them: perhaps these
remarkable feathers may serve as distinguishing
marks between the sexes. At
noon this day we were in latitude 58&deg;. 35&prime;. <span class="small">N.</span>
longitude 49&deg;. 10&prime;. <span class="small">W.</span> In the afternoon,
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
the <i>Moravian</i> Missionary brig asked, and
obtained permission, to part company: she
then quitted us, and steered more away to
the westward. During the stay of our
ship at the <i>Orkneys</i>, I had visited the brig
in question, and had there met with an old
<i>German</i> Missionary; from whom I learned,
that the difficulty of first getting on terms
of intimacy with the <i>Esquimaux</i> was almost
insurmountable. This Missionary had himself
been one of the first who succeeded in
so dangerous an object, which could only be
accomplished by placing an entire confidence
in this wild race of people: he therefore
remained alone with them, conforming
to their loathsome habits, and mildly endeavouring
to gain an ascendancy over
their minds. It was a considerable time
before he dared to attack those established
customs which, to him, appeared most exceptionable.
Habit had sanctioned polygamy
amongst them; although the nature
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
of their climate, and the difficulty of procuring
sustenance, had confined that privilege
almost exclusively to their Chiefs.
Passion was allowed to be pleaded successfully,
in extenuation of murder. It was,
therefore, with a trembling, but a resigned
heart, that the Missionary first ventured to
point out those practices as offences against
the <span class="sc">Great Spirit</span>. &ldquo;The <span class="sc">Almighty</span>,&rdquo; said
the good <i>Moravian</i>, &ldquo;assisted my humble
efforts, and my endeavours were crowned
with success.&rdquo; I shall also quote his own
words as to the result:&mdash;&ldquo;On the bleak
and rocky coast of <i>Labrador</i>, a temple
is now erected to the worship of <span class="sc">God</span>,
in which the wild <i>Esquimaux</i> raises his
voice in songs of praise to the <span class="sc">Most
High</span>. Thirty years of my life have been
dedicated to this employment; and I am
now on my return, to finish my days
amongst the flock which has been so
manifestly entrusted to my care.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>The Missionary shewed me a <i>Testament</i>,
<i>Creed</i>, and <i>Lord&rsquo;s Prayer</i>, in the
<i>Esquimaux</i> tongue: but it will be easily
imagined that many deficiencies must have
arisen in the first instance; consequently,
whenever the <i>Esquimaux</i> were at a loss for
words to express any new idea, or the name
of any article that they had not before
seen, the Missionary supplied them with a
corresponding <i>German</i> expression; as the
<i>German</i> language, of all others, is most
easily pronounced by an <i>Esquimaux</i>.</p>
<p>An <i>English</i> frigate had been on a cruize
in <i>Davis&rsquo; Straits</i>; and returning thence,
along the coast of <i>Labrador</i>, she put into a
little bay, for the purpose of procuring a
supply of wood and water. The affrighted
<i>Esquimaux</i> flew to their beloved Missionary,
and pointed out the strange vessel as the
cause of their fear: they were, however,
soon pacified, and returned quietly to their
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
occupations. Nothing, then, could equal
the astonishment of the officers, on landing;
when, instead of a wild race of savages,
prepared to oppose them, they found a small
village, inhabited by an inoffensive people,
peaceably employed in their daily duties;
and the little children going quietly to
school, with books under their arms.
Their surprise, however, must have been
greatly increased, when they were given
to understand, that all this had been accomplished
by one man, zealously actuated by
a wish of serving his <span class="sc">God</span>, in the services
he had rendered to these poor <i>Indians</i><a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a>.</p>

Light variable winds from the southward.
We were this morning visited by an officer
from one of the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i> ships; an
intelligent man, who had <i>thirty</i> times
performed the same voyage. It was his
opinion, that the sharp cold, which we had
experienced on the 18th of this month,
must have been occasioned by the vicinity
of ice; and we should doubtless have
met with it on that day, had we not fortunately
tacked about in time to avoid it.
Our latitude at noon, this day, was 58&deg;. 46&prime;. <span class="small">N.</span>,
and longitude 50&deg;. 16&prime;. <span class="small">W.</span> Towards nightfall,
the wind freshened to a fine steady
breeze from <span class="small">S. S. W.</span>; and we could plainly
discern a bright appearance in the sky,
towards the North; this was believed by
every person on board to be a certain indication
of ice in that direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>26th</i>.&mdash;Course run <span class="small">W.</span> by <span class="small">N.</span> 128 miles.&mdash;A
fine fair breeze all this day; the ship
going about seven miles an hour. In the
forenoon, we took on board the chief-mate
of the <i>Prince of Wales</i>, (one of the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i>
ships,) to act as pilot, or rather to
instruct us in the management of our
ship, amongst the ice in the <i>Straits</i>. He
immediately advised us to raise our anchors,
lest the shocks of the heavier masses of
ice should break the stocks: we also
rove smaller braces to all the yards, that
we might be able to man&oelig;uvre the ship
with the greater facility. At noon, we
were in latitude, by account, 50&deg;. 11&prime;. <span class="small">N.</span>, and
longitude 54&deg;. 20&prime;. <span class="small">W.</span> We now kept our
course more to the northward, to prevent
the possibility of our falling in with the
ice to the southward; as there are always
large quantities drifting out of <i>Hudson&rsquo;s
Straits</i>, along the coast of <i>Labrador</i>. Ships
do well, therefore, to keep to the northward,
until they reach the latitude of <i>Cape
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
Resolution</i>; and when that is attained, they
may haul in <span class="small">N. W.</span> and keep close in to
the North shore; thus making a semicircle
round the ice: but they should be particularly
cautious not to keep too much to
the North, until they reach the longitude
of 54&deg; <span class="small">W.</span> and are consequently quite clear
of the coast of <i>Greenland</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>27th</i>.&mdash;Course run <span class="small">N. W.</span> by <span class="small">W.</span> 182
miles.
As we were now getting well to the
northward, the air began to feel quite frigid;
and the wind drawing round to the East,
we hauled up North. Latitude, at noon,
was 60&deg;. 54&prime;. <span class="small">N.</span> Longitude, 59&deg;. 19&prime;. Our
distance from <i>Cape Resolution</i> we computed
to be about 171 miles. In the afternoon we
saw the first <i>iceberg</i>, which was an immense
mountain of solid ice, in the shape of an
English barn<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Towards evening, we passed another <i>iceberg</i>.
It had a complete chain of floating
fragments on the lee-side of it, through
which we butted our way. We continued
to run in for the land, all night, with a fair
wind, although it was a very thick fog, and
there were numberless <i>icebergs</i> in all directions;
indeed, it appeared to me almost
miraculous, how we escaped being dashed
upon some of them.</p>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>28th</i>.&mdash;The thick fog still continued,
until 9 <span class="small">A.M.</span> when it suddenly cleared up,
and we saw the island of <i>Cape Resolution</i>,
bearing <span class="small">E. N. E.</span> about eighteen miles distant.
We had been long wishing to get into the
<i>Straits</i>; and now that object was accomplished,
we as sincerely wished ourselves
back again into the ocean. The prospect
on every side was of the most gloomy
nature: the black and craggy mountains on
shore were only visible towards their bases;
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
their summits being covered with eternal
snows, and the aspect of the countless
<i>icebergs</i>, on all sides of us, truly terrific.
The strong southerly current continually
setting out from all the Northern seas
has been hypothetically explained, by
supposing that Nature thus supplies the
deficiency of water occasioned by the
evaporation caused by the heat of the sun
between the Tropics. It is not my intention
to discuss this philosophical question: suffice
it to say, that I can bear testimony
to the existence of such a current in all
the Northern seas, and along the Coast of
<i>Labrador</i> and <i>Newfoundland</i>, facing the
<i>Atlantic</i>; and the effect caused by the continual
flowing of the waters towards the
South, is attended with the most beneficial
effects; as the Northern seas are consequently
cleared of the vast accumulation
of ice, which would otherwise infallibly
block them up, and render all navigation
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
impracticable. We had taken care to get
into the latitude of <i>Lake Resolution</i>, before we
bore away to make the land; and although,
in running in for the <i>Cape</i>, we still continued
to steer a point to the northward of our true
course, yet, after all, the southerly current
proved so strong, as to set us to the southward
of our land-fall: and on our making
the <i>Cape</i>, it was eighteen miles to the northward
of us.</p>
<p>During the remainder of the day, we were
endeavouring, with light winds from the
<span class="small">N. E.</span> to get in with the north shore; and
towards evening we saw much field ice towards
the south. As the setting sun had a
different appearance to what it generally
exhibits in <i>England</i>, perhaps it may be
thought worthy of notice. Although it glittered
to the eye, and threw a golden tint on
the water, yet it produced no rays, and
might be viewed, for any length of time,
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
without paining the sight by its refulgence.
So far was it from bestowing warmth, that
the air appeared more intensely cold than it
had been during the whole of the preceding
day. The clouds, in parallel lines immediately
above the descending luminary,
exhibited, in the most beautiful manner, all
the varieties of the rainbow; the dusky red
and deep blue being the most predominant
colours. If to all this we add the dazzling
reflection which glittered from the snow-capp&rsquo;d
summits of the rugged mountains,
and the shining fantastic forms of the floating
<i>icebergs</i> in the <i>Straits</i>, the prospect will
easily be imagined to have excited in our
minds those feelings, which induce the
mariner, as well as the poet,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;To look, through Nature, up to Nature&rsquo;s God!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>At midnight we passed an immense <i>iceberg</i>,
which roared like a thunder storm;
occasioned, perhaps, by some cavity in its
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
side, through which the sea was bursting.
It was nearly a calm; and the surface of
the sea was quite smooth at the moment,
attended with that gentle undulating swell
which is always prevalent in deep waters.</p>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>29th</i>.&mdash;In the morning we were
obliged to tack about, in order to avoid a
large assemblage of drifting masses, termed
by the old seamen a <i>patch</i> of ice: the seals
were leaping about in all directions, and
some few sea-calves were seen. The thermometer
in the Captain&rsquo;s cabin, with a
rousing fire, stood at 43&deg;. At noon we
were plying to windward off <i>Savage Island</i>,
which is the next land to the west of
<i>Cape Resolution Island</i>, on the north shore.
<i>Savage Isle</i>, lying very low, has not so much
snow upon it, in general, as the other
parts of the coast hereabouts. The next
land to the westward of it is called
<i>Terra Nivea</i>; owing to its having some
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
mountains, about thirty miles from the sea,
entirely covered with snow. During the
remaining part of this day we continued
our course up the <i>Straits</i>, but with the
weather almost calm.</p>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>30th</i>.&mdash;We were entirely surrounded
this day with a patch of broken ice, and it
extended as far as the eye could reach. The
sun shining bright over the calm surface
of the sea, called forcibly to my mind a
description I had once read of the Ruins of
<i>Palmyra</i>, in the <i>Syrian Desert</i>; the scattered
fragments of ice bearing a strong resemblance
to the ruins of temples, statues,
columns, &amp;c. spread in confusion over a
vast plain.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p><span class="sc">July</span> <i>31st</i>.&mdash;Early in the morning of this
day we reached a remarkable cape, called
<i>Saddle Back</i>, from the resemblance that
it bears to a saddle: and as we were immediately
visited by the <i>Esquimaux</i>, I must,
for a time, quit the ship and her proceedings,
to describe the appearance, manners, and
customs of this singular race, who inhabit
the shores of <i>Hudson&rsquo;s</i> and <i>Davis&rsquo; Straits</i>,
the northern part of <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>, and
both sides of the vast peninsula of <i>Labrador</i>.
Upon the first intelligence of the approach
of the natives, I immediately jumped out
of bed, and ran upon deck; where, on my
arrival, the most discordant shouts and
cries assailed my ears. Alongside the ship
were paddling a large assemblage of canoes,
of the most curious construction: these
were built of a wooden frame-work of the
lightest materials, covered with oiled sealskin,
with the hair scraped off; the skin
being sewed over the frame with the most
astonishing exactness, and as tight as parchment
upon the head of a drum. But the
most surprising peculiarity of the canoes was,
their being <i>twenty-two</i> feet long, and only
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
<i>two</i> feet wide. There was but one opening
in the centre, sufficiently large to admit
the entrance of a man; and out of this
hole projected the body of the <i>Esquimaux</i>,
visible only from the ribs upwards. The
paddle is held in the hand, by the middle;
and it has a blade at each end, curiously
veneered, at the edges, with slips of a sea-unicorn&rsquo;s
horn. On the top of the canoe
were fastened strips of sea-horses&rsquo; hide,
to confine the lance and harpoon; and behind
the <i>Esquimaux</i> were large lumps of
whale blubber, for the purposes of barter.
These canoes are only capable of containing
one person, for any useful purpose; the
slightest inclination of the body, on either
side, will inevitably overturn them; yet in
these frail barks will the <i>Esquimaux</i> smile at
the roughest sea; and in smooth water they
can, with ease, travel seven miles an hour<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Whilst I was still busily employed in
making my remarks on the canoes of the
male Indians, a large open boat arrived,
containing about twenty women, besides
many children. This last boat was steered
by a very old man, with a paddle: he was
the only male adult amongst them. The
women pulled with oars, having a very
broad wash at the extremity; and they
cheerfully kept time to the tune of a song,
in which they all joined. The boat was
built of the same materials as the canoes;
that is to say, a frame-work covered with
oiled seal-skins; but differed, in being
shaped more after the <i>European</i> boats; also,
in having a square sail made of seal-skins,
with the hair taken off; and owing to
this difference, the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i> traders
have distinguished these boats by the
name of <i>Lug Boats</i>; although they never
attempt to use the sail, except with a fair
wind. It is difficult to give an adequate
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
idea of the delight expressed by these poor
creatures, on reaching the ships: they
jumped, shouted, danced, and sang, to
express their joy. And here it should be
observed, that the arrival of the ships is considered
by the <i>Esquimaux</i> as a sort of annual
fair; their little manufactures of dresses,
spears, &amp;c. are reserved for the expected
jubilee; and when, after long watching,
they at last catch a glimpse of the approaching
vessels, their exultation knows
no bounds.</p>
<p>The male <i>Esquimaux</i> have rather a prepossessing
physiognomy, but with very high
cheek-bones, broad foreheads, and small
eyes, rather farther apart than those of an
<i>European</i>: the corners of their eyelids are
drawn together so close, that none of the
white is to be seen; their mouths are wide,
and their teeth white and regular: the complexion
is a dusky yellow, but some of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
young women have a little colour bursting
through this dark tint: the noses of the men
are rather flattened, but those of the women
are sometimes even prominent. The males
are, generally speaking, between five feet
five inches and five feet eight inches
high; bony, and broad shouldered; but
do not appear to possess much muscular
strength. The flesh of all the <i>Esquimaux</i>
feels soft and flabby, which may be attributed
to the nature of their food. But
the most surprising peculiarity of this
people is the smallness of their hands and
feet; which is not occasioned, as in <i>China</i>,
by compression, nor by any other artificial
means, as their boots and gloves are made
large, and of soft seals&rsquo;-skin. To their continual
employment in canoes on the water,
and to the sitting posture they are thus
obliged to preserve, perhaps their diminutive
feet might be ascribed: but when we reflect
on the laborious life they must necessarily
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
lead, and yet find that their hands are
equally small with their feet, it will naturally
lead us to the conclusion, that the same
intense cold which restricts vegetation to
the forms of creeping shrubs has also its
effect upon the growth of mankind, preventing
the extremities from attaining their
due proportion.</p>
<p>The chin, cheek-bones, and forehead,
among the women, are tattooed; and this
operation is performed among the <i>Esquimaux</i>
by pricking through the skin with some
sharp instrument, and rubbing ashes into the
wound: as the marks are not deep, their appearance
is not disagreeable. I imagine that
the tattooing does not take place until the
female arrives at the age of puberty, because
the youngest girls were without any such
marks. None of the men undergo the
operation; but they have a few straggling
hairs on the chin and upper lip, while the
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
women carefully remove them from every
part of the body, excepting the head, where
they have a lock on each temple, neatly
braided, and bound with a thong of hide.
On the back of the head, the hair is turned
up, much after the fashion of the <i>English</i>
ladies. I hope the latter will not be offended
at the comparison.</p>
<p>After having gone so far in a description
of their persons, perhaps their diet ought
not to be overlooked; because it has been
before noticed, that the relaxed state of
their flesh, and the sallow hue of their
complexions, may in a great measure be
ascribed to the nature of their food. As
they seem to devour every thing raw, it has
been conjectured that they are unacquainted
with the use of fire; but this is not true.
I observed, near one of their huts, a circle
of loose stones, containing the ashes of a
recently extinguished fire, and a stone
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
kettle standing upon it<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a>: also, in a hut, I
saw a pan of vegetables, resembling spinach,
which had been boiled into the consistency
of paste<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a>. Yet, after all, it is no less certain
that an <i>Esquimaux</i> prefers all flesh raw. In
proof of this it may be mentioned, that the
Commander of the <i>Eddystone</i>, a <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i>
ship, having shot a sea-gull, an <i>Indian</i>
made signs that he wished for the bird:
immediately on receiving it, he sucked away
the blood that flowed from its mouth; then,
hastily plucking off the feathers, he instantly
dispatched the body, entrails, &amp;c.
with the most surprising voracity. The
knowledge which the <i>Esquimaux</i> possess of
the use of fire, is observable in the ingenuity
with which they transform iron nails,
hoops, &amp;c. into heads for their arrows,
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
spears, and harpoons. May not their fondness
for raw flesh have arisen from the
<i>scarcity of fuel</i>? There was not a bit of
wood to be found on that part of the coast
where I landed.</p>
<p>We made many attempts to induce the
natives to partake of our food. At breakfast,
we placed an <i>Esquimaux</i> at table, and
offered him every species of food that the
ship could afford. He tasted every thing;
but, with a broad laugh, he was sure to
eject whatsoever he tasted, over our plates
and upon the table-cloth. The only thing
they could be induced to swallow was a piece
of hog&rsquo;s lard; and of this they all partook with
avidity. Above all, they appeared to have
the greatest aversion from sugar and salt.</p>
<p>In their dealings, they manifested a
strange mixture of honesty and fraud.
At one moment I observed an <i>Esquimaux</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
striving, with all his might, to convey into
a sailor&rsquo;s hands the article for which he had
already received his equivalent; and, in ten
minutes afterwards, I detected the same
man in an endeavour to cut the hinder
buttons from my own coat. They value
<i>metals</i> more than any other article of barter,
and <i>iron</i> most of all. As a specimen of
the relative articles of traffic, I shall briefly
insert the prices which I paid for some
little curiosities<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a>; viz.</p>
<table class="center" summary="">
<tr><td class="l">A seal&rsquo;s-skin hooded frock, quite new, for a </td><td class="l">knife.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">A seal&rsquo;s-skin pair of breeches </td><td class="l">needle.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Seal&rsquo;s-skin boots </td><td class="l">saw.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">A pair of wooden spectacles, or rather shades, used by the <i>Esquimaux</i> to defend their eyes against the dazzling reflection of the sun from the ice </td><td class="l">one bullet.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">A pair of white feather gloves </td><td class="l">two buttons.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">A fishing lance or spear </td><td class="l">file.</td></tr>
</table>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>They have a strange custom of licking
with their tongue every thing that comes
into their possession, either by barter or
otherwise; and they evidently do not consider
an article as their property until it has
undergone this operation. By way of experiment,
I gave to a young girl half a dozen iron
nails: she immediately jumped, and shouted,
to express her gratitude; and then licking
each nail separately, she put them
into her boot, that being the depository of
all riches among the female <i>Esquimaux</i>,
who are entirely unacquainted with the
use of pockets. I could easily perceive
that each man had a wife; but polygamy did
not appear to exist amongst them; perhaps
more on account of their poverty, and the
difficulty of supporting a plurality of wives,
than from any idea they may entertain of the
impropriety of the practice itself. Several of
the natives brought their wives on board
the ship, and, in return for a tin spoon or pot,
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
compelled them, nothing loath, to receive
our salutations. Nay, one man plainly intimated,
that if I wished to hold any private
conversation with his lady, he should have
no objection to her visiting my cabin, provided
I rewarded him with an axe. Many
of the women had very pleasing features;
but they were so disfigured with dirt, and
their persons smelt so strongly of the seal
oil, that it required a stout heart to salute
even the prettiest of them.</p>
<p>On board the ship, they were exceedingly
curious in viewing every thing: but however
astonished or delighted they might
appear in the first sight of any novelty, yet
ten minutes was the utmost limit of their
admiration. The pigs, cats, and fowls, attracted
their attention in so remarkable a
manner, as to indicate a certainty of their not
having seen any such animals before. A
sailor threw them all into the most violent
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
fit of jumping and shouting, by walking
upon his hands along the deck. But nothing
seemed to fix their attention so much as
Captain <i>Stopford&rsquo;s</i> amputated arm<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a>: they
satisfied themselves, by feeling the stump,
that the arm was actually deficient, and
then appeared to wonder how it could
have been lost: but when I made signs to
them that it had been severed by a saw, to
the credit of their feelings, I must state, that
commiseration was depicted on every countenance.
We did not perceive an instance,
either of man, woman, or child, amongst
them, who was in any way crippled or deformed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>After breakfast, it was proposed that we
should go on shore, and a party accordingly
made: we were all well armed, as a precaution
against treachery; because this people
have been particularly accused of a disposition
that way,&mdash;whether with or without
reason, it is impossible for me positively
to say. An <i>Esquimaux</i>, who had bartered
his very last covering away for some bauble,
went with us, as a sort of pilot. On our
way to the shore, we met two of the large
women&rsquo;s boats; each steered, as usual,
by an old man. They expressed great joy
at meeting with us, by singing, shouting,
and clapping their hands; and instead of
proceeding on toward the ships, they turned
their boats, and followed us to the shore.
The coast appears to be completely fringed
with small rocky islands, and these no doubt
form a shelter to many good harbours; but
the shores of <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Straits</i> have never
been thoroughly examined, although a small
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
vessel might accomplish the task in two summers,
with ease: indeed, a voyage for this
purpose would, if well conducted, turn out
advantageously, in a mercantile point of view;
for although the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i> Company&rsquo;s
ships do not procure much oil or whalebone
from the <i>Esquimaux</i>, it is because they have
but little intercourse with this people, and
perhaps with only one particular tribe: yet
it might be very profitable to any merchant
to send a small strong brig into <i>Hudson&rsquo;s
Straits</i>, early in the month of June, so as to
reach <i>Cape Saddle-Back</i> before the Company&rsquo;s
ships arrive. The <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i> Company
would not wish to interrupt so laudable
an attempt towards opening a free intercourse
with the wild <i>Esquimaux</i> in those seas;
because the profits they derive from the traffic
in question are comparatively trifling, when
put in competition with the other more
important objects of their annual voyage.
A vessel intended for this employ should
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
not remain later than the beginning of
October in the <i>Straits</i>; and she ought to be
well provided with saws, iron lances, harpoons,
files, open knives, kettles, spoons,
hatchets, and a few beads and looking-glasses.
By coasting along both sides of
the <i>Straits</i>, and as far to the southward of
<i>Cape Diggs</i> or <i>Cape Smith</i>, she might
doubtless gather thirty or forty tons of good
oil, besides whalebone and a few skins.
But the Master of a vessel, during such
an expedition, should be particularly cautious
in not trusting a boat on shore, unless
well armed; and by no means ought he to
admit more than <i>two</i> or <i>three Esquimaux</i> at
the same time into his vessel, however
friendly they might appear to be.</p>
<p>But to return to our party, whom I left
pulling in for the shore, under the guidance
of the naked <i>Esquimaux</i>, who continued
pointing for us to proceed still farther to
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
the west, where some natives, from the
bottom of a creek, waved their hands for us
to approach. A sort of expostulation took
place between these people and our conductor,
by which it seemed, that the former
did not wish us to proceed any farther to the
west. We therefore landed, but walked
about some time without observing any
habitations; although, from the deers&rsquo; bones
and ashes which lay scattered about the
hills, it was evident that a party had not
long quitted the spot. From appearances
upon the hills, we had reason to suppose that
rabbits must be abundant; and we were
gradually receding from the sea shore in
search of them, when our guide stopped
short, and would not be prevailed upon,
by any entreaties, to accompany us farther.
We could not guess the cause of this extra-ordinary
conduct; but not wishing to give
any offence to the natives, we turned about,
and descended again to our boats. On our
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
way to the beach, we were joined by some
young girls, to whom we had been, perhaps,
rather pointedly attentive on board
the ships: they continued to pester us with
the continual whine of this people, repeating
incessantly the word &ldquo;<i>Pillitay! pillitay!
pillitay!</i>&rdquo; signifying &ldquo;<i>Give us something</i>:&rdquo;
and having now stripped us of every thing,
by their solicitations, they only seemed to
have acquired an incitement to make new
demands. It is generally the case with
all barbarous nations, that the receiving
of a gift appears to them to confer a
right to levy fresh contributions: therefore,
in all dealings with savages, it is adviseable
to teach them that something will
be expected in return for every present
bestowed; and the equivalent should be
strenuously insisted upon, let it be of ever
so trifling a nature. A departure from this
rule may, indeed, be necessary in the first
opening of a communication with a strange
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
people; but, even then, the presents ought
only to be bestowed on the principal chieftains,
priests, and women.</p>
<p>As we were upon the point of re-embarking,
one of our party offered to a young girl,
who stood on the beach, a pinch of snuff;
shewing her, at the same time, how it was
to be used. She imitated her instructor with
great exactness, giving a hearty sniff; but it
was attended with rather a violent effect; a
torrent of blood instantly gushing from her
nose. Entertaining some apprehensions lest
the natives should imagine that we had been
guilty of a premeditated injury to the poor
girl, we all made a point of taking snuff
before her: this had the desired effect, in
convincing them that no serious evil was
to be apprehended; and the young woman
went, at my request, to wash her nose in a
neighbouring pool. Unfortunately, the cold
water produced a contrary effect to what was
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
intended; the blood again streaming from
her nose: yet so far was this mild creature
from being offended, that she smilingly held
forth her hand to me, with the old exclamation
of &ldquo;<i>Pillitay!</i> (Give).&rdquo; I cut two
brass buttons from my coat, and gave them
to her; and with this atonement she was
quite satisfied. The fact is, as we afterwards
discovered, that bleeding at the nose is a
most common incident among the <i>Esquimaux</i>;
and it is certain to follow the least
exertion. Possibly this may also be occasioned
by the quantities of raw flesh they
devour daily.</p>
<p>Perhaps some readers may deem an incident
like the foregoing of too trifling a description
to merit a recital; but the manners,
dispositions, and customs of a wild people
may be better judged of from a simple relation
of the most trivial circumstances, than from
any inferences which the narrator himself
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
might presume to draw from them: therefore
I would run the chance of being
thought jejune, or even tedious, rather than
incur the greater risk of misleading others
by my own weak conclusions.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/img-075.jpg" alt="huts" width="500" height="208" />
</div>
<p>Embarking again, we pulled along shore,
towards the west, among barren rocky
islands, until we at last got sight of some huts
on an eminence at the bottom of a creek;
and putting ashore, we examined them
minutely. They are more properly tents
than huts, because they are erected much
after the fashion of a marquee: a triangle
supports the tent at one end, and two poles,
fastened at the top, at the other: over all
is thrown a covering of seals&rsquo;-skins sewed
together, the hair being scraped off: they are
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
equally impervious to air or water, and the
light is much the same as in the interior
of an <i>European</i> linen tent. At the lower
end of their dwellings is a flap of seal&rsquo;s-skin,
left loose, to answer the purpose of a door;
and when this is thrown back, a person must
stoop low to enter. If a whole family happen
to be absent from their home at the same time,
the only security for their property, during
the time they are away, consists in a few
loose stones piled against the flap of seal-skin
which covers the entrance to the tent:
and although they be not rigidly honest
towards strangers, yet the <i>Esquimaux</i> appear
to have a great respect for each other&rsquo;s property.
At the top of their huts is a piece
of wood, in an horizontal position, for the
purpose of supporting slips of the sea-horse&rsquo;s
hide to dry in the sun; and of this hide
they form a sort of rope, possessing uncommon
strength, and useful to them in a variety
of ways.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>With respect to the interior of their
habitations, it is a general custom to appropriate
the lower end or entrance of the
tent to answer the purpose of a larder,
where all their delicacies are displayed; such
as, deer&rsquo;s flesh, oil, and whale blubber. The
upper end of the tent, under the triangle,
was thickly carpeted with skins of different
animals, particularly the deer, and it is set
apart for their resting and sleeping place.
I noticed, that whenever I entered a tent,
which had not been previously visited by
any of our party, the owner of it ran forward,
with great precipitation, to conceal
something under the skins at the farther end
of the tent. Curiosity prompted me to
inquire into this mysterious conduct; and,
on removing the skins, I discovered his
bow and arrows, in a sort of seal-skin
quiver. The owner stood quite tranquil
during my search, and he did not appear
angry when the arms were produced; but
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
when I offered him a knife, with the usual
expression, &ldquo;<i>Chymo</i> (barter),&rdquo; he smiled,
as I thought, rather suspiciously; and taking
the quiver gently out of my hand, he
replaced it under the skins; at the same
time, offering me an unfinished bow, without
a string, in exchange for the knife.
As often as I continued to point to the
quiver, and make signs that I wished to
purchase the set complete, he seemed to
feel confused, and endeavoured instantly to
draw off my attention from the subject. I
tried at each tent, with no better success;
and it struck me, from appearances, that
the <i>Esquimaux</i> have some superstitious veneration
for their bows and arrows: but
their hiding them may be intended as
a compliment to their visitors, or an assurance
of their security whilst under that
roof. None of the canoes that visited us,
during our stay in <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Straits</i>, had
either bow or arrows on board; consequently,
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
they are only used by the <i>Esquimaux</i>
in their wars, and not for the purpose
of killing birds or fishes. After having said
this respecting their singular attachment
to their weapons, perhaps it will be expected
that those articles are curiously manufactured
and ornamented: but the bow
is merely made of two pieces of plain
wood, firmly corded together, and rarely
strengthened at the back with thongs of
the sea-horse&rsquo;s hide; the string is formed of
two slips of hide or dried gut; the arrows
are headed, either with iron, sea-horse&rsquo;s
teeth, sea-unicorn&rsquo;s horn, or, in some few
instances, with stone<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a>; and the whole fabrication
of the bow and arrows does not
surpass the workmanship of an English
school-boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>In one of their tents, I saw a female far
advanced in pregnancy; she was sitting
upon the ground, closely wrapt in skins as
high as her hips; and during the whole of
my stay, she never attempted to rise. It
may now be proper to relate an anecdote
of a very interesting nature; which I received
upon such indisputable authority,
that it will not admit of a doubt, as to its
veracity.</p>
<p>The land to the northward of <i>Churchill
Factory</i>, in <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>, is inhabited by
<i>Esquimaux</i>, who, contrary to the general
customs of this people, employ themselves
in hunting. They carry their furs
annually to <i>Churchill Factory</i>, for the
purpose of traffic. In one of their periodical
visits, a young woman was seen
amongst them, having a sickly infant in
her arms, respecting whose health she appeared
to be particularly solicitous; and
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
as some of the domesticated <i>Indian</i> women
in the factory, belonging to the nation of
<i>Cree Indians</i>, partly understood the <i>Esquimaux</i>
tongue, the young woman explained
to them, that, as the infant was her first-born
child, if it should unfortunately die,
her husband would undoubtedly put her
to death. The infant expired shortly after
this explanation took place; and some
<i>Europeans</i> visiting the <i>Esquimaux</i> encampment
a day or two afterwards, made inquiries
respecting the unhappy mother;
when the <i>Indians</i> silently pointed to the
spot where the poor victim was interred!</p>
<p>This circumstance has given rise to an
assertion, that if a first-born child die before
it reaches a particular age, the mother
is certain of being immolated, for a supposed
want of attention to her infant. I
had no means of ascertaining this singular
custom myself; but I have before observed,
that there did not appear either
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
sickly or deformed child or adult amongst
them.</p>
<p>Their fire-places, as before stated, are
outside the tents; and they have no need
of any in the interior, as the seal-skins that
cover them are like parchment oiled, and
will not admit the wind, nor give egress
to the breath; therefore their habitations
are not only warm, but at mid-day,
when I visited them, they were oppressively
hot. With respect to their winter
residence, I can say little or nothing. Most
people suppose that they live in caves, by
lamp-light; but the Abb&eacute; <i>Raynal</i>, who
mentions the <i>Esquimaux</i> in his History of
the <i>East</i> and <i>West Indies</i>, is of a different
opinion. As the Abb&eacute; is both correct and
incorrect, in many points of which I had
a good opportunity to judge, perhaps it
may not be amiss to give an extract from
the part of his work relating to the
<i>Esquimaux Indians</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;This sterility of Nature extends itself
to every thing. The human race are
few in number, <i>and scarce any of its
individuals above four feet high. Their
heads bear the same enormous proportion
to their bodies as those of children</i>: the
smallness of their feet makes them awkward
and tottering in their gait: small
hands, and a round mouth, which in
<i>Europe</i> are reckoned a beauty, seem almost
a deformity in these people; because
we see nothing here but the effects of a
weak organization, and of a cold that
contracts and restrains the springs of
growth, and is fatal to the progress of
animal as well as vegetable life. Besides
all this, their men, although they <i>have
neither hair nor beard</i>, have the appearance
of being old, even in their youth:
this is partly occasioned by the <i>formation
of their lower lip, which is thick, fleshy,
and projecting beyond the upper</i>. Such
are the <i>Esquimaux</i>, who inhabit not only
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
the coast of <i>Labrador, from whence they
have taken their name</i>, but also all that
tract of land which extends from the
point of <i>Bellisle</i> to the most northern
part of <i>America</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The inhabitants of Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i> have,
like the <i>Greenlanders</i>, a flat face, with
short, but not flattened noses; <i>the pupil
of their eyes yellow, and the iris black</i>.
Their women have marks of deformity
peculiar to their sex; amongst others, very
long and flabby breasts. This deformity,
which is not natural, arises from their
custom of giving suck to their children
until they are five or six years old. They
frequently carry their children on their
shoulders, who pull their mothers&rsquo; breasts
with their hands, and almost suspend
themselves by them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not true, that there are races of
<i>Esquimaux</i> entirely black, as has been
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
supposed, and afterwards pretended to be
accounted for; neither do they live under
ground. How should they dig into a
soil, which the cold renders harder than
stone? How is it possible they should
live in caverns, where they would be infallibly
drowned by the first melting of
the snows? What, however, is certain,
and almost equally surprising, is, that
these people spend the winter under huts,
run up in haste, and made of flints joined
together by cements of ice, where they
live without any other fire, but that of a
lamp hung up in the middle of the shed,
for the purpose of dressing their game,
and the fish they feed upon. The heat
of their blood and of their breath, added
to the vapour arising from this small
flame, is sufficient to make their huts as
hot as stoves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Esquimaux</i> dwell constantly near
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
the sea, from whence they are supplied
with all their provisions. Both
their constitutions and complexions partake
of the quality of their food. The
flesh of the seal, which is their food, and
the oil of the whale, which is their drink,
give them an olive complexion, a strong
smell of fish, an oily and tenacious sweat,
and sometimes a sort of scaly leprosy.
This last is probably the reason why the
mothers have the same custom as the
bears of licking their young ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This nation, weak and degraded by
nature, is, notwithstanding, most intrepid
on a sea that is constantly dangerous.
In boats, made and sewed together like
so many borachio&rsquo;s, but at the same time
so well closed that it is impossible for
the water to penetrate them, they follow
the shoals of herrings through the whole
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
of their polar emigrations, and attack the
whales and seals at the peril of their
lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One stroke of a whale&rsquo;s tail is sufficient
to drown a hundred of these assailants;
<i>and the seal is armed with teeth, to
devour those he cannot drown</i>: but the
hunger of the <i>Esquimaux</i> is superior to
the rage of these monsters. They have
an inordinate thirst for the oil of the
whale, which is necessary to preserve
the heat in their stomachs, and defend
them from the severity of the cold. Indeed,
men, whales, birds, and all the
quadrupeds and fishes of the North, are
supplied by nature with a degree of fat,
which prevents the muscles from freezing,
and the blood from coagulating.
Every thing in these Arctic regions is
either oily or gummy, and even the trees
are resinous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Esquimaux</i> are, notwithstanding,
subject to two fatal disorders; the scurvy,
and loss of sight. The continuation of
snows upon the ground, joined to the
reverberation of the rays of the sun on
the ice, dazzle their eyes in such a manner,
that they are almost constantly
obliged to wear shades of two pieces of
very thin wood, through which small
apertures for the light have been bored
with fish-bones. Doomed to six
months&rsquo; night, they never see the sun
but obliquely; and then it seems rather
to blind them, than to give them light.
Sight, the most delightful blessing of
nature, is a fatal gift to them, <i>and they
are generally deprived of it when young</i>.
A still more cruel evil, which is the
scurvy, consumes them by slow degrees:
it insinuates itself into their blood, and
changes, thickens, and impoverishes the
whole mass. The fogs of the sea, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
they inspire; the dense and inelastic air
they breathe in their huts, which are
shut up from all communication with the
external air; the constant and tedious
inactivity of their winters; a mode of life
alternately roving and sedentary; every
thing, in short, tends to increase this
dreadful malady, which in a little time
becomes contagious, and, spreading itself
through their abodes, is transmitted by
cohabitation, and perhaps likewise by the
means of generation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notwithstanding these inconveniences,
the <i>Esquimaux</i> is so passionately attached
to his country, that no inhabitant of the
most-favoured spot under Heaven quits
it with greater reluctance, than he does
his frozen deserts. The difficulty he finds
in breathing in a softer and cooler climate
may possibly be the reason of this
attachment. The sky of <i>Amsterdam</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
<i>Copenhagen</i>, and <i>London</i>, though constantly
obscured by thick and fetid vapours,
is too clear for an <i>Esquimaux</i>.
Perhaps, too, there may be something in
the change of life and manners more
contrary to the health of savages than the
climate: it is not impossible but that the
indulgences of an <i>European</i> may be
poison to an <i>Esquimaux</i>.&mdash;Such are the
inhabitants of a <i>country discovered, in
1610, by Henry Hudson</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although many parts of the foregoing
extract are strictly descriptive of the <i>Esquimaux</i>,
yet it is very evident that the Abb&eacute;
<i>Raynal</i> has undertaken to describe a people
whom he never saw: consequently, nothing
can be more absurd than those remarks
which, it may be observed, I have particularized:
and I shall now notice them, in the
order in which they occur.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>In the first place, the Abb&eacute; says, that
&ldquo;<i>scarce any of the individuals are above four
feet high!</i>&rdquo; It has been before noticed, that,
of all those whom we saw, a fair average
standard might determine their height to be
between five feet five inches, and five feet
eight inches: moreover, we even saw some
of the females five feet seven inches high.
In the next place, he observes: &ldquo;<i>Their
heads bear the same enormous proportion to
their bodies as those of children.</i>&rdquo; This,
again, is about as fabulous as those old
stories of a race having been discovered
with <i>two heads</i>. There is certainly nothing
peculiar about the heads of the <i>Esquimaux</i>,
to distinguish them from the <i>Europeans</i>;
unless, indeed, we except the enormous
quantity of thick, coarse, straight, black hair,
which covers them: and this last fact will
bear rather hard upon the next marvellous
remark of the Abb&eacute;&rsquo;s, in which he asserts
that <i>they have neither hair nor beard</i>! The
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
amazing coarseness of their hair, which
generally is as thick as a mat on their
heads, is, of all others, the most likely
characteristic to strike the attention of
a stranger: they have also a straggling
beard upon the chin and upper lip;
although, certainly, it must be admitted
that the beard never grows thick or
bushy.</p>
<p>The aged appearance of the <i>Esquimaux</i>
is, as he says, owing to the <i>formation of
their lower lip</i>!&mdash;Being able to adduce, if
necessary, the testimony of a hundred witnesses
to prove the truth of my assertions,
I shall content myself with simply stating,
that there is no such <i>projection of the lower
lip</i> as the Abb&eacute; has described. He states
that the <i>Esquimaux</i> have <i>taken their name
from the coast of Labrador</i>; but <i>Esquimaux</i>,
or <i>Skimaux</i>, is an expression, in the language
of the <i>Cree</i> and other inland <i>Indians</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
signifying &ldquo;<i>eaters of raw flesh!</i>&rdquo; and
they have bestowed this appellation on the
maritime <i>Indians</i>, in contempt; as there has
always been a most deadly hatred between
them.</p>
<p>Then again, with a bold dash of his pen,
the Abb&eacute; peoples the <i>whole of Hudson&rsquo;s Bay
with Esquimaux</i>: whereas, in fact, they
occupy but a very small proportion of it,
when compared with the vast extent of
territory inhabited by the different tribes of
Hunting <i>Indians</i>, the inveterate enemies
of the <i>Esquimaux</i>. The northern and unexplored
parts of the Bay, and the western
shore of <i>Labrador</i>, from <i>Cape Diggs</i> to the
southward, are alone inhabited by the
latter; whilst the whole of the western
and southern shores are peopled by the
former.</p>
<p>I know not what could have induced
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
him, also, to describe the <i>Esquimaux</i> as
having &ldquo;<i>the pupil of their eyes yellow, and
the iris black</i>:&rdquo; this is not true; but I suppose
that such a supposition may have arisen
from that peculiar contraction of the eyelids
which has already been noticed in the
foregoing part of this Narrative.</p>
<p>It is not less absurd to affirm, that &ldquo;<i>the
seal is armed with teeth, to devour those he
cannot drown</i>,&rdquo; than to say, that the hare is
armed with teeth, to devour those dogs
from which she cannot escape;&mdash;the
former being almost as timid an animal
as the latter; and there cannot be much
danger from the <i>rage of that monster</i>,
who coolly suffers a man to strike him a
blow over the nose, which puts an almost
immediate end to his existence.</p>
<p>I believe <i>Raynal</i> to be very correct in his
remarks on the prevalent diseases of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
<i>Esquimaux</i>; but he goes too far, in asserting
that &ldquo;<i>they are generally deprived of sight
when young</i>.&rdquo; Sore eyes, indeed, are
common amongst them; but there were
many old men without this complaint, and
few of the women were troubled with it.
&ldquo;<i>Such</i>,&rdquo; he concludes, &ldquo;<i>are the inhabitants
of a country discovered, in 1610, by
Henry Hudson</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;However, if curiosity
should lead any person hereafter to visit
the shores of <i>Labrador</i>, in the hopes of
meeting with a race of people <i>four feet
in height</i>, with <i>enormous heads</i> without
<i>any hair on them</i>, and <i>yellow eye-balls</i>,
he will be grievously disappointed: and so
far are they from being that miserable degraded
race which the Abb&eacute; describes them
to be, that they are really possessed of
industry, ingenuity, and courage; and
certainly as far superior to the disgusting
<i>Hottentot</i>, as an <i>European</i> is superior to that
race of men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>After having ventured to correct these
errors of the Abb&eacute;, it would be injustice
if I did not bear testimony to the
authenticity of his description in other
respects. The scaly leprosy, which he
mentions, is common amongst them: we at
first believed it to be the small-pox, to
which it bears a great resemblance;
but, from an attentive inspection being
made by Mr. <i>Arnot</i>, our surgeon, he was
of opinion, that the latter disease had
not as yet reached them, or that, if it had,
it must have been in its mildest form.
Almost all the men are afflicted with <i>ophthalmia</i>,
and wear the wooden shades which
the Abb&eacute; has described; but, as I before
mentioned, few of the women labour under
this disease. The pendant breasts of the
latter have certainly a disgusting appearance;
yet it is so common amongst them,
that one of the young girls shewed me,
with conscious pride, that her breasts had
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
not as yet been thus relaxed; intimating,
that she differed from the other dusky
damsels in this respect, and was therefore
to be considered as an object of greater
admiration. From which it is evident,
that they consider long breasts as a deformity,
even among themselves.</p>
<p>With respect to their winter habitations,
it is more probable that the Abb&eacute; is correct,
than that those persons are so, who entertain
the notion of their residing in caverns;
but it is not certain that the <i>Esquimaux</i>
live in a state of total inactivity during
the winter: they must, doubtless, leave
their retreats daily, in search of food: and
that they do not depend on the water for
all their supplies, is very evident, from the
number of deer-skins which may be observed
in every habitation.</p>
<p>It is now pretty well ascertained that the
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
tribes of <i>Esquimaux</i>, inhabiting the northern
shores of <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Straits</i>, migrate, in the
fall of the year, towards the south; for the
double purpose of taking up their winter
quarters, and of procuring fuel and game
amongst the pine-tree forests of <i>Labrador</i>.
The northern shore of <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Straits</i> is,
from end to end, a barren rock; having no
mark of vegetation, except here and there a
tuft or two of wild sorrel, or scurvy-grass:
consequently, the wooden frame-work of
the canoes, the poles for their summer-tents,
and the handles of their fishing-spears, can
only be procured by the <i>Esquimaux</i> during
their annual migrations to the coast of <i>Labrador</i>.
Add to this, that, on our visit to
their tents, we observed five or six large
boats, hauled up on the shore, and completely
laden with all sorts of furs and
necessaries, as if preparatory to a speedy
removal of the whole tribe into winter
quarters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>I should not have been led into so long
a digression, had it not been from a wish
to correct the very erroneous statements,
of even the most eminent authors, respecting
this singular race. That those authors
have derived their descriptions from the
confused accounts of other writers, is
evident, by the gross mistakes they have
fallen into. It is indeed probable, that,
of those who have written upon this
subject, no one ever personally visited the
<i>Esquimaux</i>: neither is it a surprising thing
that they have not done this, because
the <i>Esquimaux</i> have always been represented
hostile to strangers, prone to
treachery, and exceedingly disgusting in
their persons.</p>
<p>To return, then, to our party.&mdash;We
continued roving for some time amongst the
habitations of the <i>Esquimaux</i>; and could
not help admiring the various ways in
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
which they contrive to render the seal
useful: indeed, this creature may be said
to supply them with food, light, clothes,
houses, beds, boats, and casks. The blubber
of the seal is either eaten, or converted
into oil for the winter lamps; the skin, with
the hair on, is made into frocks, breeches,
boots, and stockings; and with the hair
scraped off, and well oiled, the skin serves
also for a covering to their houses and
boats: numbers of them, heaped together
with the skins of bears and deer, constitute
their beds: lastly, after having carefully
skinned a seal, the females sew the hide
neatly up; then fill it with wind, like
a bladder, and dry it in the sun; and, after
this preparation, it fully answers all the
purposes of a cask, for containing oil, or any
other liquid for which it may be required;
in the same manner as the mountaineers of
<i>Spain</i> and <i>Portugal</i> carry their wine in
the skins of animals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>The <i>Esquimaux</i> have various methods of
killing the seal; but the most common is,
by spearing him with a long lance, which
they discharge from a <i>throwing stick</i>, exactly
in the same manner as described by
<i>Cook</i> to be in use among the natives of
<i>Otaheite</i>. The seal, when once struck,
becomes an easy prey: a large bladder,
affixed to the dart, effectually prevents his
sinking; and a heavy log of wood, also fastened
to the dart, acts as a drag, to prevent his
swimming away with any velocity. They
have also a manner of passing the handle
of the lance through the centre of a sort of
tambourine; which, in this case, is substituted
for the drag: of course, the seal is
soon exhausted, with the efforts he is compelled
to make, in pulling this machine
against the water; and a blow on the
nose, from his pursuers, soon puts a period
to his existence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>After leaving their huts, we stood on the
top of a hill, with the whole of the remaining
population of the place around us:&mdash;I
say, the remaining population; because
many of the natives were still trafficking on
board the ships. From their numbers, I
should think that either several families
must reside in one tent, or that there were
other hamlets along the shore, at a short
distance, from whence we had visitors; as
the assemblage on the hill with us consisted
of ten men, twenty women, and fourteen
children; and yet there were only nine
finished tents, and four or five in the frame.</p>
<p>Nothing, as before observed, can be more
troublesome than the continual solicitations
of these people for gifts; men, women,
and children, tormented us incessantly with
&ldquo;<i>Pillitay! pillitay! pillitay!</i>&rdquo; It became
therefore, at last, absolutely necessary, in
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
our own defence, to invent some means of
diverting their attention from these importunities.
Accordingly, one of our party,
who was well acquainted with the manners
of the <i>Indians</i> in <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>, began
a song in the language of the <i>Cree</i> tribe.
The <i>Esquimaux</i> gaped with great astonishment
and evident pleasure, preserving the
most profound silence, until he gave a loud
shout, as a finale; when they sat up an universal
shouting and jumping, and it appeared
as if they were half beside themselves
with delight: yet we were certain
that they understood nothing of the sense
of the song. We thought this a good
opportunity to petition them for a similar
favour: our signs were instantly comprehended,
and a ring immediately formed,
consisting entirely of women, with the
exception of an old man, whom we recognised
to have seen before, as steersman
of one of the large women&rsquo;s boats.
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
This old man began the song; walking,
at the same time, in a circle; followed
by the women, with their backs to each
other. At a certain turn in the air, the
women all raised their voices; I shall not
say in a chorus, as it appeared more like a
continuation of the song. After a short
time, the women suffered their voices to
die gradually away, in the most plaintive
manner; and the old man again resumed
the song alone, until a similar turn again
brought in the women&rsquo;s voices. This
alternation lasted a considerable time;
during which they still continued to walk
round in a circle, and all the while
bestowed the most friendly smiles upon
us. Meantime, the men stood scattered
outside the ring; and whenever the old
man resumed his song, they jumped,
shouted, and laughed, in the most extravagant
manner. One of the men at last kissed
two of the females, making plain signs for
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
us to take the same liberty, in rotation, with
the whole circle; at the same time uttering,
repeatedly, the exclamation, &ldquo;<i>Coo-nee!</i>&rdquo;
We, however, pretended not to comprehend
his meaning, as we were not
at all desirous of so indiscriminate a salutation.
I noticed one of the women earnestly
making the same gesticulations, and
crying out &ldquo;<i>Coo-nee!</i>&rdquo; also; but as we did
not comply, they soon after finished the
song. We adopted their own method of
jumping and shouting, to express our satisfaction;
at which they seemed particularly
well pleased.</p>
<p>Preparing now to leave this interesting
spot, we descended to the sea, followed by
the whole of the natives: and as I turned
about to observe if there were any thing
belonging to their tents which had before
escaped our notice, my eyes rested upon a
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
group of about a dozen huge dogs, around
a piece of whale blubber. It is really surprising
what numbers of these animals the
<i>Esquimaux</i> uselessly support during summer;
but they are amply repaid by the benefits
derived from them in the winter; as the
dogs are then employed to drag the sledge of
their owners, after the manner of the reindeer
in <i>Lapland</i>. In <i>Newfoundland</i>, and
in its environs, large dogs are also used, for
the purpose of transporting fire-wood, and
other articles, over the snow: and I have
been assured, by a respectable merchant,
who resides occasionally at <i>Lance-a-Loup
Bay</i> on the southern coast of <i>Labrador</i>,
that he has travelled one hundred miles in
twenty-four hours, in a sledge drawn by
ten brace of dogs: they are not accustomed
to reins, but two well-trained dogs are
placed foremost, and the whole are then
managed by a singular kind of whip, the
use of which it is difficult to acquire, as the
handle is but three feet long, and the lash
fifteen.<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a></p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>After giving away amongst the natives
all the metals we possessed, even to the
buttons of our coats, we embarked;
and resting upon our oars, at a trifling distance
from the shore, we gave them three
hearty cheers. This was merely intended
by us as an experiment; but the effect produced
by it surpassed in interest any thing
that we had yet seen amongst this
people.</p>
<p>The echoes of our huzzas had scarce subsided,
before the three young girls, who
had attended us the whole day, stepped
down to the edge of the water; having
each of them previously drawn on a pair of
gloves made of white feathers. They first
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
held out their arms, in an horizontal position,
with the fingers extended; then waved
them to and fro, with an undulating motion;
and, at last, suddenly sunk them towards the
earth. Again, recommencing for a short
time the waving of their hands, they finished
this affecting ceremony by extending both
arms, to their full extent, towards the
right side, pointing their snow-white
gloves towards the sky. They continued
to repeat the same motions without the
least variation, until we began to pull
away from the shore; when they ceased
entirely, and retired into the crowd of natives,
who had stood behind the three girls
during the foregoing exhibition, and, in
profound silence, appeared to be watching
every motion. Never had we seen a
more interesting spectacle: the young
<i>Esquimaux</i> kept the most exact time with
each other, and accompanied their gestures
by the most graceful motion of
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
their heads; their eyes bespeaking, at the
same time, the most tender solicitude for our
safety. It is not a trifling matter that can
agitate, even for a moment, the rough feelings
of a seaman; yet the crews of our
boats sat, during this scene, in mute
astonishment, with their mouths wide open;
and at last, with the utmost reluctance,
we tore ourselves away.</p>
<p>Unlike the generality of savage nations,
this people did not exhibit any dances
peculiar to themselves: the only instance
that we observed, to prove they have an
idea of dancing, was on board the ship;
here a young girl threw one leg out, and
then another, alternately, for some time;
when, stopping suddenly, she shut her eyes,
and, holding her head down, fell to
moaning and howling, as if in great pain:
next followed a convulsive gurgling in
the throat, and deep-drawn sighs; then
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
gradually opening her eyes, and relaxing
her features into a smile, she repeated the
whole over again.</p>
<p>It is a curious fact, that the inland or
hunting tribes of <i>Indians</i> in <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>
believe the <i>Esquimaux</i> to be a nation of
sorcerers. Should the season prove a bad
one in procuring their furs, they say that
the <i>Esquimaux</i> have enchanted the game;
and they then set off to the northward, to
punish them accordingly. Whenever they
discover the tents of the supposed magicians,
they remain lurking about the place until
a favourable opportunity offers; when,
raising the dreadful war-whoop, they rush
on to the attack with inconceivable fury.
Every individual of the vanquished is
instantly massacred, whether they make
resistance, or implore for mercy. The
animosity between them is hereditary,
bloody, and implacable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>When Mr. <i>Hearne</i> travelled to the <span class="small">N. W.</span>
in search of the long-sought passage to the
<i>Southern Ocean</i>, he was escorted by a party
of <i>Cree Indians</i>, and was himself an eye-witness
of the massacre of an <i>Esquimaux</i>
tribe; although he used his most earnest
entreaties with his conductors, to spare
an innocent-looking young girl who had
supplicated his protection: the <i>Indians</i>
frowned furiously upon him; and asking,
with haughty contempt, <i>if he wanted an
Esquimaux wife</i>, they speared her to death
on the spot<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a>.</p>
<p>It is rather remarkable, that the habitations
of the <i>Esquimaux</i> had never before been
visited by the officers of the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i>
ships, although they had often landed in
the Straits: but this may be explained
in two ways. In the first place, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
<i>Esquimaux</i> are evidently anxious to conceal
their places of abode; secondly, the commanders
of the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i> ships have
directions from the Company not to go on
shore amongst the <i>Esquimaux</i> themselves,
nor to send their boats; and they have
orders also to be continually on their guard,
in all communications with this people.
Possibly these orders have been issued since
the horrid termination of an attempt to
establish a permanent white whale fishery
at <i>Richmond</i>; and probably that circumstance
may have given rise to the regulation.
I shall relate the dreadful story in the
sequel, when I reach that part of my
Narrative where it will be necessary to
give a short description of the factories
in <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>: it would be considered
as too long a digression to insert it at
present. We had the good fortune,
therefore, to be the first <i>Europeans</i> who,
for the last forty years, have visited the
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
habitations of the <i>Esquimaux</i>. I have thus
been enabled to describe them fully, from
my own observations. And there is another
point upon which I am able to speak
<i>positively</i>, although the circumstance did
not fall under my own inspection: I allude
to the manner of disposing of their dead.</p>
<p>His Majesty&rsquo;s ship <i>Brazen</i>, Captain <i>Stirling</i>,
in the year 1813, convoyed the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i>
ships into the Bay. Captain <i>Stirling</i> and some
of his officers landed in the Straits, but could
not find any habitations of the natives:
however, in wandering about the hills, they
discovered an object of no less curiosity;
namely, the dead body of an <i>Esquimaux</i>:
it was closely wrapt in skins, and laid in a
sort of gully between two rocks, as if
intended to be defended from the cold winds
of the ocean: by the side of the corpse lay
the bow and arrows, spears, and harpoon
of the deceased; together with a tin pot,
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
containing a few beads and three or four
<i>English</i> halfpence: the last articles had
evidently been procured by the deceased in
traffic with the Company&rsquo;s ships.</p>
<p>The reason of the body having been laid
on the surface of the earth, is in consequence
of the impossibility of penetrating the flinty
rock, of which the whole coast is composed;
and the custom of depositing his arms by
the side of the corpse of a deceased <i>Indian</i>,
is common to many barbarous nations.<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>As it may be expected that something
should be said respecting the government
and religion of the <i>Esquimaux</i>, I shall
briefly state, that they did not appear to
me to trouble their heads with either. They
certainly paid great respect to the old man
who sang to us the song before mentioned;
but it does not necessarily follow that he
was either a prince or a priest. It is probable
that they venerated him more on
account of his age, than from any civil or
ecclesiastical authority with which he was
invested. But the <i>Esquimaux</i>, and all other
nations around <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>, have a notion
of a superior spirit, whom they concur in
styling <i>Man&eacute;to</i>, or <i>Good Spirit</i>. It is not
known whether the <i>Esquimaux</i> have any
idea of an Evil Being; but the <i>Cree Indians</i>
imagine that there is a great number of
that species, whose sole delight consists in
tormenting mankind<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>With respect to the language of the
<i>Esquimaux</i>, I have been able to collect
a few specimens: and I shall insert, against
each word, in what part of the coast each
expression was ascertained to be in use,
and the authority from whence I derived
my information.</p>

<p>Having given a short account of the
<i>Esquimaux</i>, their manners, and customs,
I may now proceed with my Journal as
before; and content myself with making
a few cursory remarks, as we sail along.</p>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>1st</i>.&mdash;The whole of this day
we continued off <i>Saddle Back</i><a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a>; as the
<i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i> ships had some arrangements
to make, previous to their final separation,
which always takes place off <i>Mansfield
Island</i>, at the entrance of <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>.
Towards evening, we began to ply to
windward, with a fresh breeze at west.
Thermometer 40&deg; in the shade.</p>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>2d</i>.&mdash;Beating to windward with
a strong breeze, in the afternoon we hove-to
off <i>Icy Cove</i>, about a mile to the westward
of two remarkable hills, called the
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
<i>Virgin&rsquo;s Paps</i>, which last lay nine leagues
to the westward of <i>Saddle Back</i>. On
firing a gun and hoisting our colours,
we were immediately visited by another
party of <i>Esquimaux</i>: there was no difference
whatever in their appearance from those
we had seen before. One of our officers
purchased a canoe of a native, for which
he paid a kettle, a lance, a saw, and a spoon.
Our curiosity was considerably excited, to
observe in what manner this man would
contrive to reach the shore; and we really
entertained serious apprehensions for his
safety, when we perceived him stretch
himself out upon his belly on another canoe,
at the back of the man who used the
paddle. He was in this dangerous position
conveyed to land, not daring to lift his
head, through fear of destroying the
equilibrium of the canoe; which did not
swim two inches above the surface of the
sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>After night-fall, we were compelled to
tack ship about, to avoid a large patch of
floating ice.</p>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>3d</i>.&mdash;We continued plying to
windward all this day; and in the evening
we had reached <i>Upper Savage Island</i>. It
lays about twenty-three leagues to the west
of <i>Saddle Back</i>, in an opening which has
never been explored. Thermometer 32&deg; in
the sun.</p>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>4th</i>.&mdash;Towards the evening of
this day we had a fair wind, the ship butting
her way through immense quantities of ice.
Passed by a bluff cape, called <i>Point Look-out</i>.
This cape is eight leagues to the west of
<i>Upper Savage Island</i>. We saw a number
of <i>Esquimaux</i> following us among the
windings of the loose ice. These poor creatures
laboured hard to overtake us, hallooing
and shouting &ldquo;<i>Chymo!</i>&rdquo; but we were
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
now exceedingly anxious to get forward,
and therefore could not wait for them; at
which their disappointment must have been
great.</p>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>5th</i>.&mdash;This morning forcing our
way with difficulty through the ocean of
ice that surrounded us; at length, being enveloped
in a thick fog, and the wind dying
away, we lashed our ship to a large piece
of ice; and firing three guns as a signal for
our convoy to do the same, we were
astonished at the effect produced by the
cannon, The explosion issued like thunder
over the ice; then appeared to roll
rumbling back towards the ship; bellowing
forth again in tremendous peals. The
echo died away in distant reverberation.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, we imagined that we
could distinguish the sound of voices
through the fog: we immediately beat the
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
drum, to point out our situation; and, in a
few minutes, we plainly heard the shouting
of the <i>Esquimaux</i>: they soon came alongside
the ship, with the usual expressions of
delight. It is really surprising that this
people should venture so far from the land,
in such frail barks, through a mass of ice
which is enough to daunt an <i>European</i>,
even in a stout-built ship.</p>
<p>The fog clearing away, we cast the
ship loose, and endeavoured to force our
way forward among the ice; until, from its
increasing consolidation, we were again
obliged to lash to a large piece of it. This
operation is called <i>grappling</i>; and it is performed
by running the vessel alongside of
the piece of ice to which it is intended
to make her fast: two men then leap on
the ice: the one runs, with a sort of pickaxe,
to dig a hole in it, using the precaution
to stand with his back to the ship; and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
other man follows the first, with a serpent-like
iron on his back, having a strong rope
affixed to one end of it: this serpent (or
ice-anchor, as it is termed) is hooked into
the hole on the ice, and the rope is
fastened on board the ship. Other ice-anchors
and ropes are then hooked to different
parts of the piece of ice; and the
number of ropes is varied according to the
state of the weather. In a gale of wind,
we had generally five anchors a-head; and
with a moderate breeze, not more than
two. The whole man&oelig;uvre of grappling
is generally accomplished in five minutes;
and although the ship be lashed to windward
of a clump of ice, yet the action of the
wind on a vessel&rsquo;s masts, yards, &amp;c. turns
the ice round, and she will consequently
soon be under the lee of it, with water as
smooth as a mill-pond.</p>
<p>We were employed this evening in filling
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
our casks from a pool of snow-water on the
ice; and our people were highly diverted
with running upon it, leaping, playing
at foot-ball, and shooting at seals. At
length, four of the seamen were so imprudent
as to venture on a sort of peninsula
which projected from the main body of the
ice; when the isthmus instantly gave way,
leaving them adrift on a small piece that
was barely sufficient to sustain their weight.
It was long after night-fall, and with the
utmost exertion and difficulty, that we succeeded
in getting them safe on board
again, by the help of a boat.</p>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>6th</i>.&mdash;In the middle of the night,
the prospect from the ship was one of the
most awful and sublime that I ever remember
having witnessed, during a life spent
entirely upon the ocean: and I regret
that no language of mine can give an
adequate idea of the grandeur of the scene.
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
As far as the eye could reach, a vast alabaster
pavement overspread the surface of the sea,
whose dark blue waters could only be
seen at intervals, where parts of the pavement
appeared to have been convulsively
torn up, and heaped upon each other in
ruined fragments. The snow-white surface
of this immense plain formed a most striking
contrast to the deep black clouds of a
stormy night; through which, uninterrupted
flashes of forky lightning succeeded each
other with great rapidity, as if intending, by
their fiery glare, to shew to us the horrors
of our situation, and then to magnify them
by leaving us in utter darkness. Add to this,
the reiterated peals of thunder that burst
forth, in a thousand roaring echoes, over the
surrounding ice; also the heavy plashing
of the rain, which poured down in torrents;
the distant growling of affrighted
bears, the screams of sea-birds, and the loud
whistling of the wind;&mdash;the whole forming a
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
midnight prospect which I would have gone
any distance to see; but having once beheld,
never wish to witness again.</p>
<p>In the morning, we were surprised
by the appearance of two <i>Esquimaux</i>, who
had contrived to reach the ship, although
we were at least seven leagues from the
land, and the ice closely hemming us
round on all sides: the Indians had effected
their passage by dragging their canoes
over the different fields of ice which
obstructed their progress. At 4 <span class="small">A.M.</span> we
got under sail; as there appeared a possibility
of our pushing through, the ice
having loosened a little; however, we looked
in vain for an opening. The ship running
fast, with a fair breeze, struck violently
upon a large field, and the shock fairly lifted
up her bows. We continued butting through
until 8 <span class="small">A.M.</span> when we grappled to a large
field of ice, as an impenetrable mass now
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
presented itself on all sides of us: the wind
shifted into the <span class="small">N. W.</span> and blew a heavy gale,
accompanied by drifts of snow and sleet.
We lay in this position all night, closely
hemmed in, with five ice-anchors a-head.
An inspection being made by the carpenter,
he found that the heavy shocks
which the ship had received this day had
started the ceiling about her bows, and also
twelve or fourteen of the trunnels.</p>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>7th</i>.&mdash;During the whole of this
day, we continued closely wedged in by the
ice. It blew a hard gale from the west,
attended by a heavy fall of snow and sleet.
The loose ice was incessantly varying its
position: at one time, we were so closely
hemmed in as to be hardly able to discern
any water; then, suddenly, the ice would
again open to a considerable distance. This
is easily accounted for; as the light pieces
of ice drift much faster before the wind
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
than the heavier masses, which are deeper in
the water: it will naturally occur, therefore,
that the three ships would alter their
position, according to the size of the clump
to which they were fastened. The <i>Eddystone</i>
was three miles to the east of us last
night; and at sunset this evening, she was
as far to the west; yet that ship was still
grappled to the same piece of ice as before;
and, from the coagulated mass which surrounded
us, one would have been led to
conclude that the relative distance from
each other could not have been so easily
altered: but it varies according to the depth
and solidity of the ice to which the ships
are affixed.</p>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>8th</i>.&mdash;In the forenoon, the snow
ceased to fall, and we had a finer day. Latitude,
by an observation at noon, 62&deg;. 54&prime;. <span class="small">N.</span>
The ice loosened considerably in the course
of the day, but not sufficiently for us to
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
get under sail. At night-fall, we lost sight
of the <i>Eddystone</i>, to the west.</p>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>9th</i>.&mdash;The day had just began to
dawn, when an animal was observed swimming
near the ship: we at first conjectured
it to be a seal, and accordingly sent a quarter-master
over the ice, to knock it on
the head, if it attempted to get upon it;
but the man was fain to make a rapid retreat,
when he discovered the form of a
prodigious bear emerging from the water.
This enormous creature came close to the
ship&rsquo;s head; and had I been armed with a
pistol only, it would have been easy to have
dispatched him; but during the time we
were all bustling for a musquet, the bear
marched up the field of ice. Mr. <i>Wells</i>,
a young midshipman, and myself, instantly
pursued him, by different routes; but the
grey of the twilight was favourable to him;
and his hide being but a shade or two
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
deeper than the ice itself, he escaped unseen.
We afterwards traced his footsteps
to the edge of the ice, opposite the spot
where he landed, and he must therefore
have replunged into the sea from that place.
I mention this circumstance to shew in
what manner these animals contrive to procure
subsistence: they swim, during the
night, in the quiet manner now described;
and drawing close to a piece of ice, they
immediately smell if there be any seals upon
the top of it; in which case they ascend
gently on the opposite side, and suddenly
springing upon the sleeping seal, they instantly
tear it in pieces.&mdash;As this proved to
be a fine day, we drew our seamen out
upon the ice, and exercised them by firing
at a target. Towards evening the ice began
to loosen considerably.</p>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>10th</i>.&mdash;A fine day; but the ice
still close. Wind remains at <span class="small">N. W.</span> During
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
the last twenty-four hours, the <i>Eddystone</i>
again appeared in sight; and towards evening,
she again neared us considerably. We
believed this to be owing to her having got
into a southerly current. Our latitude this
day was 62&deg;. 50&prime;. <span class="small">N.</span>; and at night-fall the
thermometer stood at 28&deg;.</p>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>11th</i>.&mdash;At 4 <span class="small">A.M.</span> ungrappled,
and got under sail, with a fair wind, running
a zig-zag course amongst the ice; the
ship, at intervals, striking excessively hard.
Towards evening, we again grappled to
a piece of ice; and, upon inspection, we
found several more trunnels started, and
the ship much shaken, by her repeated
blows. The Admiralty must certainly have
been deceived by the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i> Company,
respecting a Voyage to <i>Hudson&rsquo;s
Bay</i>; or they certainly would never have
sent a ship of war to perform it, without
previously strengthening her for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
occasion. It is exceedingly dangerous for
any ship to attempt a passage through
the sea of ice in <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Straits</i>, unless her
bows be doubled with oak-plank and
heavy blocks of wood, bolted to each side
of her cutwater; as the floating masses of
ice may be considered so many <i>rocks of
crystal</i>.</p>
<p>This day, in a vacancy between the ice,
we saw the first regular whale. On his
second rising to blow, I discharged a load
of small shot into his back; at which, however,
he did not even seem to feel the least
annoyance, though we saw him no more.</p>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>12th</i>.&mdash;At day-light, ungrappled,
with a light wind at south; but, to our
great mortification, we were again obliged
to anchor, at noon, to a field of ice about
half a mile long; and both the other ships
made fast to the same piece, so that we could
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
walk across the ice to visit each other. Our
people were immediately set to work; and
in three hours&rsquo; time, we had filled fifty-six
casks with snow-water, from a large pond
on the ice. We had <i>Charles&rsquo; Island</i> in sight,
bearing <span class="small">W. N. W.</span> about nine leagues distant.
This small island is on the southern shore
of the Straits, in the narrowest part;
the channel there not being above
twenty miles broad. <i>Charles&rsquo; Island</i> lies
about twenty-one leagues to the west of
<i>Lady Lake&rsquo;s Inlet</i>; and hence the ships
leave the northern shore, and steer for
the south end of <i>Salisbury Island</i>, lying off
Cape Diggs, at the western extremity of
<i>Hudson&rsquo;s Straits</i>.</p>
<p>The ice continuing very close all around
us, we were compelled to remain in this
situation, without ungrappling, for five
days; in which nothing occurred worthy
of notice.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>17th</i>.&mdash;In the morning, we were
opposite a deep inlet, called <i>Prince of Wales&rsquo;s
Sound</i>, on the southern shore of the Straits,
which has never been explored. All this
coast, as well as the northern shore, is
fringed with islands; the principal of which
are called <i>King George</i>, <i>Prince of Wales</i>,
<i>Maiden&rsquo;s Paps</i>, and <i>Mannil&rsquo;s Islands</i>; and
they doubtless afford shelter to many fine
harbours.</p>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>18th</i>.&mdash;We did not grapple
during the night, but hove to, for about two
hours, whilst it continued dark; and at
day-light we again bore up, and continued
running through loose ice. Towards noon
it fell nearly calm: we observed seven large
seals, basking on a piece of ice; but as
soon as we approached them in a boat, they
rolled into the water, and disappeared. We
were visited by two <i>Esquimaux</i> in the afternoon:
they had nothing remarkable about
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
them, except that their mustachios were
rather more bushy than those we had seen
before. In the evening it fell quite calm,
and we grappled.</p>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>19th</i>.&mdash;During the night, the
other ships had fallen considerably to the
eastward; but the wind coming round to
the south-west, we ungrappled, and waited
for their coming up. <i>Queen Anne&rsquo;s Foreland</i>,
a high cape on the north shore, bore
<span class="small">E. N. E.</span> nine leagues; and although at so
great distance, we were visited by three
canoes of <i>Esquimaux</i>, bringing their usual
commodities for traffic. Our latitude this
day was observed to be 63&deg;. 38&prime;. <span class="small">N.</span>; longitude,
72&deg;. 45&prime;. <span class="small">W.</span> We grappled again in the
evening, and lay so until&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>21st</i>.&mdash;At 2 <span class="small">A.M.</span> was presented
one of those awful appearances which are
so common in these hyperborean regions.
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
The water, for some distance around the
ship, had, for a time, been partially cleared
of the ice; when, on a sudden, a noise was
heard like very distant thunder, and the
crackling of falling beams in some immense
conflagration. The loose ice, which had
appeared so distant before, now approached
on all sides with an unusual rapidity; the
pieces driving one over another in their
course, and seeming to menace the destruction
of our ship. In ten minutes we were
completely hemmed in, on all sides; and a
person might travel for miles over a space
which had just before been an expanse of
water. The ice must have been forced together
by some extraordinary meeting of
the currents, as there was but a slight
breeze at the moment.</p>
<p>At noon, the wind became fair: we ungrappled,
and steered through loose weighty
ice until 8 <span class="small">P.M.</span> when a thick fog came on,
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
and we again grappled for the night. About
10 <span class="small">P.M.</span> the deep darkness of the sky was
suddenly changed to a bright twilight; and
having continued so for about five minutes,
it again relapsed into its former gloom. This
singular appearance was occasioned by a
streamer of the <i>aurora borealis</i> bursting
through the thick fog which surrounded us.&mdash;Thermometer
29&deg;.</p>
<p>During our stay in <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>, and
upon our voyage home from thence, our
nights were constantly illuminated by the
most vivid and brilliant coruscations of the
<i>aurora borealis</i>. Its appearance was very
different from that which I have seen in
more southern latitudes; resembling continual
jets of meteoric fire from the northern
part of the horizon, which, after darting
upwards in long streamers towards the
zenith, suddenly collapsed, and receded;
falling back, in zig-zag, serpentine lines, with
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
diminished splendour; and ultimately dying
away, and vanishing from the sight; being
succeeded by other jets, as beautiful as the
first. The <i>Cree Indians</i> inhabiting <i>Hudson&rsquo;s
Bay</i>, and indeed the <i>European</i> traders there,
maintain, that, in the serene stillness of
their severe winters, a soft rushing noise
constantly accompanies these coruscations,
like that which is occasioned by the quick
waving of a <i>fan</i>, or of a <i>winnow</i>. The same
remarkable circumstance is mentioned by
<i>Hearne</i>, who bears positive testimony to
the fact. &ldquo;I can positively affirm,&rdquo; says
he<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a>, &ldquo;that in still nights I have frequently
heard the <i>northern lights</i> make a rustling
and crackling noise, like the waving
of a large flag in a fresh gale of wind.
This is not peculiar to the place of which
I am now writing (<i>the Athapusco Lake</i>),
as I have heard the same noise very plain
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
at <i>Churchill River</i>: and, in all probability,
it is only for want of attention that it has
not been heard in every part of the
northern hemisphere, where these lights
have been known to shine with any considerable
degree of lustre.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>22d</i>.&mdash;Early in the morning we
again ungrappled. The reader of this Journal
may easily conceive that, by this time, our
impatience was at its height, as we had
now been nearly a month incessantly occupied
in endeavouring to push our ship
through the never-ending drifts of ice in
<i>Hudson&rsquo;s Straits</i>. I shall not, therefore,
attempt to describe the joy of every person
on board, when at 8 <span class="small">A.M.</span> we emerged into
an open sea, and, the wind blowing tolerably
fresh, at ten we passed by <i>Charles&rsquo;
Island</i>. At noon, we had lost sight of both
land and ice; and we now sailed forwards
at a great rate, with both our ships in
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
company. Towards night-fall, we passed by
a low level island, called <i>Salisbury Island</i>,
which lies at the entrance of <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>23d</i>.&mdash;In the morning, passed to
the southward of <i>Nottingham</i>, a long rocky
island, lying north of <i>Cape Diggs</i>. I know
not if <i>Salisbury</i> and <i>Nottingham Islands</i> are
inhabited by the <i>Esquimaux</i>; but it is natural
to suppose that this people visit them
occasionally, during their periodical voyages.
At 8 <span class="small">A.M.</span> we were off <i>Cape Walsingham</i>,
which is only remarkable for its being the
north-west promontory of <i>Labrador</i>, and
having a string of small islands running
from it towards the sea.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the <i>Eddystone</i> parted
company; as that ship was bound for <i>Moose
Factory</i>, at the southernmost extremity of
the bay; whilst we intended to proceed with
the <i>Prince of Wales</i> to <i>York Factory</i>, on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
western side. And now, having brought
the ship safely through these formidable
Straits, and conducted her into the immense
gulf of <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>, we will leave
her for a while to pursue her voyage, and
take an excursion round the <i>Bay</i>, in order
to give some short description of its factories,
inhabitants, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Amongst the many adventurous naval
enterprises which reflect such lustre upon
the last years of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, and
the beginning of the reign of <i>James</i>
the <i>First</i>, none, perhaps, can surpass,
in intrepidity and perseverance, the voyages
of <i>Henry Hudson</i>; undertaken for the express
purpose of effecting a north-west
passage to the <i>Pacific Ocean</i>. All that I have
been able to collect respecting this brave but
unfortunate man is, that he sailed in the
year 1610, and discovered the Straits which
now bear his name. He boldly pushed his
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
way through them; and finding that, after
a length of six hundred miles, he emerged
into an open sea, his heart beat high with
exultation on having, as he doubtless imagined,
succeeded in discovering that famous
passage for which so many had sought in
vain<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a>. Sailing forward, therefore, four
hundred miles towards the west, his disappointment
was great, at finding himself
suddenly stopped, in the midst of his career,
by an unknown coast, extending (as has since
been ascertained) from 51&deg; to 63&deg; <span class="small">N.</span> latitude.
However, the spirit of <i>Hudson</i> was not easily
checked; and, astonishing as it may appear,
he determined on remaining the whole
winter on this dreary coast, so that he
might be able to prosecute his voyage early
in the ensuing spring. After suffering innumerable
hardships, this daring adventurer
sailed, early in the next year, towards
the north, in search of the much-wished-for
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
outlet to the <i>Pacific</i>; but his crew, not feeling
the same enthusiasm which animated
their leader, and greatly fearing lest his ardent
thirst for discovery might expose them to
the horrors of another winter, or, what was
still worse, to the chance of perishing amidst
the terrific mountains of ice with which
they saw themselves to be surrounded, they
accordingly proceeded from murmurs to open
mutiny; and having turned the heroic <i>Hudson</i>
adrift in a small boat, together with the
few who adhered to his fortune, they basely
left their leader to perish, and sailed away
for <i>England</i>, where they arrived in safety.
As for the unhappy Captain, I grieve to
add, that he was never afterwards heard of:
neither have we the poor consolation of
knowing that his murderers met with the
punishment due to their inhuman crime.
There can be no doubt that <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>
would have remained much longer unexplored,
had it not so happened that the
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
winter preceding the year in which the discovery
was made must have been remarkably
mild; consequently, <i>Hudson</i> could not
have met with many obstacles in passing
through the Straits;&mdash;no seaman would have
endeavoured to penetrate farther, if he had
found them so completely blocked up with
ice as to impede a ship&rsquo;s progress, even
with the advantage of a favourable wind
attending her;&mdash;and that this was the case
with us, will appear evident, from a perusal
of the preceding part of this Journal.</p>
<p>The <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i> Company&rsquo;s charter is
said to confirm to that body the whole and
sole right of trading with the <i>Indians</i>,
within the limits of <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Straits</i>; and
they have no less than six factories established
at the mouths of as many different
rivers, which empty themselves into the
Bay. The northernmost of these factories
is called <i>Churchill</i>: it stands on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
west side of the Bay, in latitude 58&deg;. 50&prime;. <span class="small">N.</span>;
longitude, 93&deg;. 4&prime;. <span class="small">W.</span> The port is tolerably
good, and ships of any size may anchor in
it. At the entrance is a danger, called <i>Cape
Mary&rsquo;s Rock</i>; but it is easily to be avoided.
On entering <i>Churchill River</i>, ships pass between
two points of land. One of them
forms a sort of peninsula; and it has a large
strong fort of stone upon it, the erection of
which is said to have cost the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i>
Company 30,000<i>l.</i>: it was formerly mounted
with twenty 32-pound guns. The opposite
Cape (<i>Mary</i>) has also a small battery, which
formerly had six guns on it; yet, with the
most culpable pusillanimity, did the traveller
<i>Hearne</i> (who acted as chief at that
time) yield this strong position to the
<i>French</i> Admiral <i>La Perouse</i>, without so
much as attempting a defence; who, in the
year 1782, spiked the cannon, and destroyed
the factory. Since that time, the fortifications
of <i>Churchill</i> have been suffered to remain
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
in their present dilapidated state; and, as a
trifling security against any sudden invasion
in future, the new factory was erected at a
short distance higher up the river. It is
matter of surprise, that the Company do not
repair the large stone fort, which is made uncommonly
strong, both by nature and by art.
As it stands upon the extremity of a peninsula,
a body of men passing the isthmus to
attack it by land, would be completely exposed
to the enfilading fire of the fort. It
would be difficult also for an enemy to
force the gates, because there is a small half-moon
battery built on that side, expressly for
their defence. Besides, there are dwelling-houses
in the interior of the fort, sufficiently
large for the reception of the whole factory.</p>
<p>The shore about <i>Churchill River</i> is high
and rocky, producing only a very few insignificant
trees and shrubs. Farther north,
towards the country of the <i>Esquimaux</i>, this
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
small vestige of vegetation dwindles away
even to a simple bush or two, and these are
only to be found at a considerable distance
from each other.</p>
<p>Proceeding southward, towards a more
genial country, we arrive at <i>York Factory</i>,
standing upon low swampy ground,
completely covered with wood: its latitude
is 57&deg;. 2&prime;. <span class="small">N.</span>; longitude 92&deg;. 40&prime;. <span class="small">W.</span> This
place was also visited by the <i>French</i> in
1782, who burnt the factory, and destroyed
a small battery at the entrance of <i>Hayes&rsquo;
River</i>. But <i>Perouse</i> was grievously disappointed
in the chief object of his voyage:
and as it is so intimately connected with the
subject on which I am writing, perhaps it
will not be thought improper to describe
the disappointment which the <i>French</i> suffered
in the expedition; particularly as the
fitting-out of the squadron must have cost
the <i>French</i> nation much money; and their
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
burning a few miserable mart-houses in
<i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i> could only injure individuals,
and most probably was not felt at all by the
public.</p>
<p><i>Perouse</i> entered <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i> in 1782,
having under his command a line-of-battle
ship and two large frigates. With this
force he of course insured the capture of
the annual ships, together with their rich
cargo of furs, oil, &amp;c.; and as the escape of
the three ships does high honour to the
skill and intrepidity of their commanders,
it is well worthy of notice. The ship which
was bound to <i>Churchill</i>, was commanded by
Captain <i>Christopher</i>; and the <i>French</i> admiral
fell in with her at sea, just previous
to her arrival at that place. A frigate was
immediately dispatched in pursuit; but the
night drawing on apace, Captain <i>Christopher</i>
resolved on a bold man&oelig;uvre, which
he accordingly carried into execution with
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
great success. Perceiving that the <i>Frenchman</i>
was ignorant of the coast, and, by his
following the <i>English</i> ship, that he was determined
to govern his own vessel by her
motions,&mdash;whereby he hoped to avoid all
danger, and in the end secure his prize,&mdash;Captain
<i>Christopher</i> sent his men aloft, and
furled his sails, pretending to come to an
anchor. The enemy immediately conjectured
that it would be dangerous for him
to proceed farther; therefore he directly
brought his frigate to anchor in reality.
Captain <i>Christopher</i> rejoiced that his deception
had so far succeeded to his wishes;
and he made sail to sea with the greatest
dispatch. Night coming on, and the <i>Frenchman</i>
being a long time in getting up his
anchor, the <i>Englishman</i> was soon out of
sight, and escaped in safety to the northward.
Fired with this disappointment,
<i>Perouse</i> burnt the factory; and proceeded to
<i>York</i>, to secure the other ship, then lying
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
at that place, under the command of
Captain <i>Fowler</i>. As there was not depth of
water sufficient for his ships to enter <i>York</i>,
he anchored in <i>Nelson River</i>, and made
every disposition for an attack upon the
ship and factory by the dawn of the next
day; but, to his utter mortification, he
found in the morning that the bird had
taken wing;&mdash;for Captain <i>Fowler</i> had perceived
three large ships at anchor in <i>Nelson
River</i> the evening before, and, wisely conjecturing
that they could have no good intentions
towards him, put to sea during
the night. <i>Perouse</i> dispatched a fast-sailing
frigate in search of him, which soon had
sight of the runaway; but Captain <i>Fowler</i>
finding the <i>Frenchman</i> to have much superiority
in point of speed, tacked about, and
stood in for the land to the south of <i>York</i>,
hoping thereby to entice the <i>Frenchman</i>
into shallow water: the enemy, however,
discovering his design, and fearing lest,
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
in further pursuit, he might incur the risk
of shipwreck, put off to sea; and Captain
<i>Fowler</i> pursued his voyage to <i>England</i>
in safety. The season was too far advanced
to attempt any other exploit; and having
therefore burnt the factory at <i>York</i>, <i>Perouse</i>
returned to <i>Europe</i>; highly chagrined, no
doubt, at being thus foiled by a pair of
<i>English</i> sailors, and at having failed of success
in the principal aim of his expedition.
As there are many shoals and dangerous
rocks in <i>James&rsquo; Bay</i><a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a>, he did not think fit
to send a ship to destroy the southern settlements:
and to the credit of this unfortunate
navigator, I must state, that he publickly
averred, if he had been aware of the
factories being the property of individuals,
he would assuredly have quitted them without
molestation. It is remarkable that the
Bay ship (as she is called) got safe to <i>Moose
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
Factory</i>, and returned to <i>England</i>, without
being at all aware how very narrowly she
must have escaped falling into the hands of
the enemy.</p>
<p>The next factory to the south of <i>York</i> is
called <i>Severn</i>; but the shore at this place
runs off much too shoal to allow a ship to
approach the coast; therefore a schooner
of about eighty tons is employed to take the
furs to <i>York</i>, and to bring back the necessary
supplies. This is also the case with
<i>Albany</i>, the next factory towards the south;
except that the latter place sends its furs,
&amp;c. to <i>Moose</i>, instead of <i>York Factory</i>.</p>
<p>At the very bottom or southernmost
part of <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>, which is styled
<i>James&rsquo;s Bay</i>, we arrive at <i>Moose Factory</i>;
standing, like all the rest, on a river,
bearing the same name. This place has
a good anchorage, and the climate is
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
milder than in any of the other factories.
It is annually visited by a ship from <i>England</i>;
as at <i>Moose</i> the furs are collected
together from the lesser mart-houses of
<i>Albany</i>, <i>East Main</i>, and <i>Richmond</i>, for
the purpose of being shipped off to <i>Europe</i>.
We must now proceed round the bottom of
the Bay;&mdash;and the next settlement is at <i>East
Main River</i>, nearly opposite to the western
shore of <i>Labrador</i>. The factory was established
at this place for the purpose of
trading with the natives of that vast
peninsula; but their internal mart-houses
verge generally towards the south, and
the marten skins from this factory are
said to be the finest in quality of any
which are received from <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>.
The inhabitants around this settlement are
a roving race of people, styled, by the <i>Europeans</i>,
<i>Mountain Indians</i>, to distinguish
them from the <i>Esquimaux</i>, who inhabit the
sea-coast to the northward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>At some distance to the north of <i>East
Main</i> is a bight, called <i>Richmond Bay</i>:
here is a house belonging to the Company,
but not a permanent establishment; as the
people who arrive from <i>East-Main Factory</i>
in the spring, return again to that place
in the fall of the year, to remain for the
winter. The annual voyages to <i>Richmond</i>
are undertaken for the purpose of procuring
oil, as there is a good white-whale fishery
in this Bay. The white whale<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a> is not much
larger than a first-rate porpoise; neither
does it yield any whalebone fit for use: but
the oil is nearly equal in value to that of
the seal; and it was sold in <i>England</i>, in the
year 1813, at fifty-six pounds a ton. The
fish itself is perfectly white.</p>
<p>There is also a small whale fishery at
<i>Churchill Factory</i>, but it is not very productive:
perhaps it would be more advantageous
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
for the Company if they were to
convert the remains of it into a new
fishing establishment in some more efficient
situation.</p>
<p>I have now reached that part of my Journal
which I before alluded to, as being the
most proper place to introduce the account
of the disastrous termination of two attempts
made by the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay Company</i>
to settle a permanent white-whale fishery
at <i>Richmond Bay</i>.</p>
<p>When first the <i>Europeans</i> went to settle
at <i>Richmond</i>, the <i>Esquimaux</i>, who reside
about this part, kept them in a continual
state of alarm all the winter, by lurking
about the woods, in their sledges drawn by
dogs. At length an English boy was missing
from the settlement; and, after some
difficulty, two <i>Esquimaux</i> were seized, and
confined in separate apartments. In order
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
to recover the absent youth, the settlers
made use of a stratagem. A musket was
discharged in a remote apartment; and the
settlers entering the room in which one of
the <i>Esquimaux</i> was confined, they informed
him, by signs, that his comrade had been put
to death, for decoying away the boy; and
they gave him to understand, at the same
time, that he must prepare to undergo the
same fate, unless he would faithfully pledge
himself to restore the absentee. The <i>Esquimaux</i>
naturally promised every thing; and
on being set at liberty, he made the best of
his way into the woods, and, of course, was
never afterwards heard of. They kept the
other native for some time a prisoner: at
length, he tried to effect his escape, by
boldly seizing the sentinel&rsquo;s firelock at
night, but the piece accidentally going
off, he was so terrified at the report,
that they easily replaced him in confinement:
yet either the loss of liberty, a
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
supposition that his countryman had been
murdered, or that he was himself reserved
for some cruel death, deprived the poor
wretch of reason. As he became exceedingly
troublesome, the settlers held a conference
as to the most eligible mode of
getting rid of him; and it being deemed <i>good
policy</i> to deter the natives from similar
offences, by making an example, they accordingly
shot the poor maniac in cold
blood, without having given themselves the
trouble to ascertain whether he were really
guilty or innocent.</p>
<p>Possessing only the plain leading facts
of this affair<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a>, it is not easy to determine
how far existing circumstances might have
justified such an act of severity towards an
ignorant being, who was also, perhaps,
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
totally innocent. The reasons ought certainly
to have been weighty which induced
them to put the poor man to death;
and I hope they will be able hereafter to
reconcile the deed to God and to their own
consciences.</p>
<p>After this time, <i>Richmond</i> was abandoned
as a permanent establishment; and they fell
into the present method of visiting this
place only during the fishing season, and
returning to pass the winter at <i>East-Main
Factory</i>. Captain <i>Turner</i>, however, represented
to the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay Company</i>, that,
in his opinion, want of perseverance was
alone necessary to render <i>Richmond</i> a safe
and permanent settlement; and that, by
having people on the spot, ready to begin
fishing early in the spring of the year, much
greater profit would necessarily accrue to
the Company. Accordingly, he received
directions to take thither seven people, who
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
were to remain at <i>Richmond</i> during the
whole winter. In the spring of the succeeding
year, the northern or <i>Hunting
Indians</i>, who had visited <i>Richmond</i> in pursuit
of game, came, as usual, to barter their furs
at <i>East-Main Factory</i>; at the same time
bringing the dreadful intelligence that the
seven unfortunate <i>Europeans</i> had been
murdered by the <i>Esquimaux</i>. The bodies of
some of the settlers were afterwards found;
although it be by no means certain that
they were killed by the <i>Esquimaux</i>: such,
however, is a fair presumption, as this people
had before displayed a hostile disposition in
the case of the boy; and the place was rifled
of all the metal, of which the <i>Esquimaux</i>
are known to be remarkably fond: add to
this, that the northern <i>Indians</i> had long
been accustomed to trade yearly at <i>East
Main</i>, and no instance had ever been known
of their behaving with treachery towards
the <i>Europeans</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>On the other hand, we must allow, that
the <i>Hunting Indians</i> and the <i>Esquimaux</i> live
in a state of constant enmity, and, consequently,
that their evil reports of each other
should be cautiously received. It is also
certain, that the northern <i>Indians</i> are as
partial to spirituous liquors as the <i>Esquimaux</i>
are to metals. Three bloody shirts,
belonging to the murdered settlers, were
found in the tent of a northern <i>Indian</i>,
which he alleged to have taken from the
bodies of the slain, after the <i>Esquimaux</i> had
quitted them. Upon the whole, it remains
uncertain whether the settlers at <i>Richmond</i>
perished by the hands of the <i>Esquimaux</i>, or
by those of the northern <i>Indians</i>: for my
own part, I should be inclined to the former
opinion. This catastrophe has effectually
put a stop to any further attempts towards
establishing a permanent settlement at <i>Richmond
Bay</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>The following anecdote of Mr. <i>Darby</i>, the
father of the celebrated Mrs. <i>Mary Robinson</i>,
will shew that the <i>Esquimaux</i> are of a treacherous
disposition, and extremely averse
from any settlements being made on their
coasts.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Darby</i> had long fostered in his
mind a scheme of establishing a whale
fishery upon the coast of <i>Labrador</i>, and of
civilizing the <i>Esquimaux Indians</i>, in order
to employ them in the extensive undertaking.
Hazardous and wild as this plan
appeared to his wife and to his friends, Mr.
<i>Darby</i> persevered in his resolution to
prosecute it; and actually obtained the
approbation and encouragement of some
of the leading men at that time in power,
who promoted his designs. To facilitate
the execution of his plan, he deemed it
necessary to reside at least two years in
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
<i>America</i>. His wife felt an invincible
antipathy for the sea, and, of course, heard
his determination with horror. The pleadings
of affection, of reason, and of prudence,
were alike ineffectual, and he sailed
for <i>America</i>.</p>
<p>The issue of this rash enterprise proved
quite as unfortunate as it was predicted.
Mr. <i>Darby</i> had embarked in it his whole
fortune; and it failed. The noble patrons
of his plan deceived him in their assurances
of marine protection, and the island
of promise became a scene of desolation.
&ldquo;<i>The Indians rose in a body, burnt his settlement,
murdered many of his people, and
turned the product of their toil adrift on
the merciless ocean.</i>&rdquo;&mdash;This great misfortune
was followed by other commercial
losses; and the family of this too
enterprising man were, in consequence,
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
reduced from a state of affluence and
luxury to a very different condition<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a>.</p>
<p>Having now described the whole of the
Factories established upon the sea-coast of
<i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>, it will be necessary to say
something of the interior: this is so far
from being unknown, that a man may with
safety travel from <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i> to <i>Quebec</i>,
in <i>Canada</i>, by land. The <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay
Company</i> have many small factories, or
rather mart-houses, dispersed in all directions,
for upwards of one thousand miles in
the interior; to which the <i>Indians</i> bring furs,
feathers, quills, &amp;c. in exchange for cloths,
blankets, ammunition, fowling-pieces, trinkets,
&amp;c. The furs thus collected are sent
down the rivers, in large boats, to the factories
on the sea-coast, whence they are
shipped off for Europe, as before described.
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
There is great jealousy existing between
the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i> traders and the <i>Canadian
Company</i>, styled the <i>North-West Adventurers</i>,
respecting the traffic in <i>peltry</i> with
the <i>Indians</i>. As the mart-houses of the two
parties meet inland, each uses all the
means in its power to induce the natives
to barter furs with themselves, in preference
to their opponents: nay, to such a
pitch have they carried their mutual animosity,
that it is not long since a man in the
Company&rsquo;s employ actually killed a <i>Canadian</i>
trader, in a dispute relative to the purchase
of some furs from the <i>Indians</i>; for which
offence the culprit was tried at <i>Montreal</i>:
and as it appeared that the <i>Canadian</i> had
given him sufficient provocation, the jury
returned a verdict of manslaughter.</p>
<p>The <i>Indians</i> have not failed to observe
this competition, so impolitic on both parts,
and they profit by it accordingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>Each factory and mart-house has its <i>Chief</i>,
appointed by the Company; and there is
also a northern and southern Superintendant,
who is directed to visit all the places
of note within his district, at least once in
the year. The northern department comprises
<i>Churchill</i>, <i>York</i>, and <i>Severn</i> factories,
on the coast; and the southern embraces
<i>Albany</i>, <i>Moose</i>, <i>East Main</i>, and <i>Richmond</i>.
To determine the interior limits of each,
an imaginary line of demarcation is drawn
east and west from <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i> to the
<i>Stony Mountains</i>.</p>
<p>With respect to the inhabitants of this
vast desert I shall say but little, as Sir
<i>Alexander M<sup>c</sup>Kenzie</i> has given a very full
description of the various tribes by which it
is peopled<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a>. The most populous of all,
perhaps, are the <i>Cree Indians</i>: they appear
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
to me to be the same race described by the
before-mentioned author, under the name
of <i>Knisteneaux</i>. They occupy the country
from <i>Churchill</i> nearly as far south as <i>Moose</i>,
and are found scattered almost as far to the
west as the <i>Stony Mountains</i>; but their
numbers have been much diminished of late,
owing to the small-pox. When this dreadful
malady first reached this country, as the
<i>Indians</i> were not aware of any remedy by
which they could counteract its violence,
they were accustomed to leave the person
afflicted in the midst of a wood, with a sufficient
stock of food for two or three days&rsquo;
subsistence; and when this scanty provision
was expended, the unhappy victim
must have necessarily perished with hunger.
The banks of the rivers, for a time, exhibited
a most loathsome spectacle, of bodies
which had thus fallen a sacrifice to this
disorder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>Besides the <i>Cree</i> or <i>Knisteneaux Indians</i>,
there are innumerable tribes spread over the
interior of this vast country; the principal
of which are, the <i>Copper</i>, <i>Dog-ribbed</i>,
and <i>Hare-foot Indians</i>, towards the north;
the <i>Swees</i>, <i>Bongees</i>, <i>Slave</i>, and <i>Stone Indians</i>,
towards the west; likewise a variety of
tribes inhabiting the southern country
around <i>Moose</i>, such as the <i>Mistassins</i>, and
others. The different tribes have frequently
wars with each other; and they appear to
agree unanimously in one respect only, that
is to say, in universal and eternal hatred of the
<i>Esquimaux</i>. However, it fortunately happens,
from the contrariety of their modes of life,
that their parties seldom come into contact
with each other, and consequently the battles
between them are very rare.</p>
<p>It remains now to speak of one of the
most enterprising speculations, perhaps, ever
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
undertaken by a single person; namely,
the attempt lately made by Lord <i>Selkirk</i> to
establish a colony upon the banks of the <i>Red
River</i>, in a situation nearly equidistant
from <i>York Factory</i> and <i>Lake Superior</i>, and
in the latitude of 50&deg; <span class="small">N.</span><a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a></p>
<p>His Lordship holds this land by a grant of
12,000 square acres from the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay
Company</i>. The first settlers left <i>Sligo</i> in
the year 1811; and arriving in <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>,
they past the winter of that year at <i>York
Factory</i>. In the spring of 1812, they proceeded
to their destination, under the command
of a Captain <i>M<sup>c</sup>Donald</i>, formerly
belonging to a veteran corps in <i>Canada</i>:
but this gentleman seems deficient in the
essential art of conciliating those who are
placed under his government: however,
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
the situation of the colony is undoubtedly
good, and the soil so fertile as to
produce every thing almost spontaneously.
The winters, indeed, are more severe
than in places upon the same parallel of
latitude in Europe, but much milder than
at <i>Moose</i>, or any of the factories in <i>Hudson&rsquo;s
Bay</i>; and yet even at <i>Moose</i> they produce
barley, if it be a fine year; and <i>Orkney</i> oats
every year, by sowing them a short distance
from the sea-beach. Still, it is extremely
doubtful if ever his Lordship&rsquo;s descendants
will derive much benefit from their father&rsquo;s
mighty speculations; unless, indeed, he
could prevail upon his tenants to grant
him a sort of tithe from their produce,
in lieu of rent. With this corn he could
supply the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i> settlements,
which would save the Company a considerable
expense, and they might repay
his Lordship in the current coin of the
realm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>The <i>Prince of Wales</i> took out many
women and settlers for the colony, as also
a Mr. <i>White</i>, to act as surgeon. Lord <i>Selkirk</i>
has agreed with this gentleman, to give
him a yearly stipend of 100<i>l.</i> together with
a grant of five hundred acres of land, and a
labourer four days in the week for its cultivation.</p>
<p>It is difficult to imagine what were his
Lordship&rsquo;s intentions with respect to the
colony at <i>Red River</i>. Allowing the luxuriance
of the soil to answer his fullest
expectations, by what possible means could
the produce be conveyed to an adequate
market, so as to repay the expenses of
its carriage? The communication between
the colony and <i>York Factory</i> is kept up by
boats, through the great <i>Lake Winnepeg</i>; a
little to the southward of which runs the
<i>Asnaboyne</i> or <i>Red River</i>: yet the channels
of the different rivers are so full of falls,
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
rapids, portages and carrying-places, that
the labour of conveying the boats is immense,
and consequently quite unfit for the
purposes of commerce, except it be in furs,
and in such light merchandize.</p>
<p>It was for some time believed that a
large opening to the northward of <i>Richmond</i>,
and near to <i>Cape Smith</i>, was an inlet
to some large inland sea; but, in the year
1786, Mr. <i>Davison</i>, an officer in one of the
Company&rsquo;s ships, was sent in a schooner to
explore the same. The following extract
contains the description of his progress, as
expressed by himself. &ldquo;On entering the
bight, and perceiving no land a-head, we
sat down to a bottle of wine, and drank
success to the new discovery: however,
we were soon chagrined by the appearance
of some low islands stretching across
the opening; and shortly afterwards, coming
to an anchor under one of them, we
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
climbed to the top of it, and, to our great
mortification, we perceived that the supposed
sea was nothing more than a deep
gulf, terminated at the bottom by thick
clusters of islands, among which the sea
ran winding in romantic mazes. Here we
found the <i>Esquimaux</i>, who bartered away
their dresses, &amp;c. with great avidity, for
any sort of metal.&rdquo;&mdash;Notwithstanding this
clear statement, there are experienced men
who still suppose that an inland sea does
exist; and for these reasons:&mdash;1st. There is
a continual current setting to the east from
<i>Cape Henrietta Maria</i>, towards the supposed
opening; 2dly, The bay ship, in
her voyage to <i>Moose</i>, has frequently
observed a large glut of loose ice off <i>Cape
Henrietta Maria</i>, which, before her return,
has entirely disappeared; and whither
could it have drifted with a strong
easterly current, unless some opening
had admitted its escape from the bay?&mdash;These
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
are the reasons for and against the
existence of the supposed sea; but it is to
be regretted, that the Company do not make
a decisive attempt to ascertain the fact.</p>
<p>It will now be necessary to return to the
proceedings of the ship.</p>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>24th</i>.&mdash;Course run <span class="small">S. W.</span> by <span class="small">W.</span>
&frac14;<span class="small">W.</span> 34 miles. In the morning, past to
the northward of <i>Mansfield</i>, a very long,
low, level island, lying about seventeen
leagues to the westward of <i>Cape Diggs</i>. Its
extent from north to south is said to be full
sixty miles. As it abounds with marshes
and ponds of fresh water, it may be
considered as the grand nursery of those
innumerable flocks of wild geese and
ducks which afterwards line the shores of
<i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>: however, it is but seldom
visited; and the ships generally avoid going
too near to it, in consequence of some
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
shoals that lay around the shore. Towards
evening, we steered away <span class="small">W. S. W.</span>
by compass.</p>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>25th</i>.&mdash;Course run <span class="small">S. S. W.</span> &frac34; <span class="small">W.</span>
101 miles. As there is generally a glut of
ice floating about the centre of <i>Hudson&rsquo;s
Bay</i>, a ship, on leaving <i>Mansfield Island</i>,
and having a northerly wind, ought to
steer for <i>Cape Churchill</i>, until they reach
within sixty leagues of the land, when they
may alter the course, and steer for <i>York</i>
direct. It is necessary to make this angle,
to avoid the body of ice in question. Another
thing worthy of remark is, that if a
ship steer in for <i>Cape Churchill</i> until she
have forty fathoms water, she may be
certain of being in latitude of the Cape:
and when she reaches within five or six
leagues of the land, she will have eighteen
fathoms water. But a navigator must be
cautious to make allowance for the southerly
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
current, which sets continually along the
western coast of <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>26th</i>.&mdash;Course run <span class="small">S. W.</span> &frac14; <span class="small">S.</span> 56
miles. The wind this day to the <span class="small">S. S. W.</span>
Our latitude at noon was 60&deg;. 11&prime;. <span class="small">N.</span> ship
still standing to the westward. It has
been already noticed, that the officers of
the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i> ships have a motive in
concealing from the public the knowledge
which they actually possess relative to
the navigation of the Northern Seas; and
I pledged myself to explain that motive
at a proper opportunity. I cannot undertake
this unpleasant task at a more apposite
time than the present, when it may
serve to enliven the dulness of a few nautical
remarks, which I think it necessary to
insert into this part of my Journal.</p>
<p>In the first place, it is proper to state,
that this illiberal concealment has its
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
origin in the Company themselves, who
(as I am told by their own officers) have
issued the strictest and most peremptory
commands to the people in their employment,
&ldquo;that they take especial care to conceal
all papers, and every other document,
which may tend to throw light upon the
Company&rsquo;s fur-trade.&rdquo;&mdash;It is probable
that the Company had no other motive in
issuing these directions, than to keep themselves
and their gains shrowded in a profound
silence; as it appears that, above all
other things, they wish their trading concerns
not to become a topic of general conversation
in the mother-country. Actuated
by such principles, the officers of the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i>
ships conceive it to be their duty
to conceal likewise all those remarks which
their experience has taught them to make
upon the navigation of the <i>Northern Seas</i>:
consequently, nothing can be more incorrect
than the Chart supplied by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
<i>Admiralty</i> for the guidance of a man-of-war
in <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Straits</i>: it absolutely bears no
resemblance to the channel of which it is
intended to be an exact delineation. During
the time we continued in <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Straits</i>,
the <i>Rosamond</i> was entirely piloted by a
chart belonging to the chief mate of the
<i>Prince of Wales</i>, and one of his own making;
yet he was so jealous of his performance,
that he was highly offended at our
Master&rsquo;s having endeavoured to take a copy
of it; and from thenceforward kept his
charts carefully locked up. When I questioned
him, with some freedom, on this
mysterious conduct, the selfish motive stood
at once confessed: he feared lest, from
others attaining the same knowledge as
himself, they might be induced to enter into
the service of the Company, and thereby
possibly supplant him in his situation. And
such I found to be the motives which induced
the majority of these experienced
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
seamen to keep their truly valuable information
concealed within their own
bosoms. After the foregoing statement,
it will be unnecessary to explain my
reasons for inserting the very few nautical
observations which I was enabled to
collect.</p>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>27th</i>.&mdash;Course run, <span class="small">W. S. W.</span> &frac14; <span class="small">W.</span>
87 miles.</p>
<p>We continued running all this day across
the bay, with a fine leading wind. Our
latitude at noon was 59&deg;. 40&prime;. <span class="small">N.</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>28th</i>.&mdash;Course run <span class="small">W. S. W.</span> 74
miles.</p>
<p>At noon this day we sounded, and found
that we were in eighty fathoms water.
About sun-set we observed a large body of
ice to windward; our latitude at this time
58&deg;. 56&prime;. <span class="small">N.</span>; and longitude, by chronometer,
89&deg;. 50&prime;. <span class="small">W.</span> It is about this spot that the
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
<i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i> ships generally calculate on
seeing ice, allowing they meet with it at all.</p>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>29th</i>.&mdash;Course run <span class="small">S.</span> by <span class="small">W.</span> &frac14; <span class="small">W.</span>
68 miles.</p>
<p>At 1 <span class="small">A.M.</span> we sounded in sixty-seven fathoms
water. At four in the morning, the
wind suddenly increased to a violent gale,
which died away again at sunset. Our latitude
at noon was 58&deg;. 6&prime;. <span class="small">N.</span>; longitude, 90&deg; <span class="small">W.</span>
Towards night-fall we sounded in forty-two
fathoms, with a muddy bottom; and
at the same time we caught an owl and a
hawk, which we considered as sure signs of
the vicinity of land.</p>
<p><span class="sc">August</span> <i>30th</i>.&mdash;As we were now running
in to make the land, I shall insert a
Table of the Soundings, taken from the
depth of water, which we ascertained last
night at sun-set.</p>

<p>At eight in the morning, it will be observed,
we were in 8&frac12; fathoms water, on
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
<i>York Flats</i>; and we therefore came to an
anchor, with the beacon, at the mouth of
<i>York River</i>, bearing <span class="small">S. W.</span> by compass; the
land being distant about ten miles, although
it could barely be discerned in a blue line
above the horizon. Thus, it may be observed,
we had been sixty-three days on our
voyage; and that it may be compared with
other voyages to <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>, I have annexed
to this Journal a Schedule<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a> of those
performed by the Company&rsquo;s ships since
the year 1788; although I have not been
able to obtain the dates of their departures
from the <i>Orkneys</i>.</p>
<p>By the Sounding Table which I have inserted,
it is evident that the depth of water
abreast of <i>York River</i>, and off <i>Cape Tottenham</i>,
to the southward, is uncommonly
regular; and it may therefore be fairly concluded,
that, although the western coast of
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
the Bay be very low land, yet there is no
great danger in making it.</p>
<p>It is not expected that ships during their
return to <i>Europe</i> will ever meet with loose
ice<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a>: therefore, as soon as our ship anchored
on <i>York Flats</i>, we <i>undid</i> all the
preparations which had been made for
man&oelig;uvring whilst amongst the ice; such
as, re-stowing our anchors, and putting
below ice-ropes, ice-anchors, ice-axes, &amp;c.;
and we rejoiced in being rid of them.</p>
<p>The factory was about twenty miles
distant from the anchorage of the ship,
but not visible. At 10 <span class="small">A.M.</span> I went,
therefore, from the ship, to report our
arrival to the Governor. We were met at
some distance from the ship by a large boat
from the factory. It appeared that they
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
had noticed the arrival of the ship; and mistaking
her for the <i>Prince of Wales</i>, the boat
was immediately despatched for letters,
parcels, news, &amp;c. &amp;c. Finding their
mistake<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a>, the boat returned with us to the
factory, which we reached about nine at
night. On landing, we were hailed by a
sentinel; and a guard of honour was drawn
out to receive us, with a pair of <i>Highland</i>
bagpipes in front. The guard was
composed of the traders, boatmen, and
others, belonging to the factory: and
through the gloom of the night I discerned
the Governor and his officers, standing
in a group to receive us. After the
necessary business of introduction was over,
we walked up to a large wooden building,
surrounded by a double row of wooden
palisades; and here we were regaled with
venison steaks and buffalo tongue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p><span class="sc">Sept.</span> <i>1st</i>.&mdash;At 2 <span class="small">A.M.</span> the tide answering
for our return, we quitted the factory, and
reached the vessel again about 8 <span class="small">A.M.</span></p>
<p>Whilst we were at <i>York Fort</i>, we received
information that the factory at
<i>Churchill</i> had been burnt to the ground, in
the month of <i>November</i>, 1813. The miseries
which the people of that place suffered
during the remainder of the winter were
very great. As there were seventy-three
chests of gunpowder in the warehouse at
the time the conflagration took place,
their whole attention was occupied in
removing away the powder to prevent an
explosion; and by the most strenuous exertions
they succeeded in this undertaking;
but the time lost prevented their being
able to save a mouthful of provisions, or a
single utensil, from the flames. An old out-house
that had escaped destruction, and a
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
few tents which they erected of rein-deer
skins, served them as habitations during
the remainder of the winter; and, as if
Providence had taken especial care to
provide for their necessities, partridges
abounded to a greater degree than had been
known for many years before. Of course,
these birds proved a seasonable supply to
the sufferers; particularly as the partridges
are so very tame, that they suffer themselves
to be driven into nets, by which means large
quantities are taken at one time.</p>
<p>A family in <i>England</i> would be justly
esteemed objects of great pity, if they were
burnt out of their home in the midst of
winter, although many friendly habitations
might be humanely opened for their reception.
What then, comparatively speaking,
must have been the situation of the
<i>Churchill</i> people&mdash;driven out by the flames
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
in the middle of a <i>November</i> night, on the
shores of a frozen ocean, with the thermometer
78&deg; below the freezing point, without
any shelter save that of a decayed out-house,
no bedding, no cooking utensils, no immediate
nourishment, and no final prospect of
relief, except from a reliance on the adventitious
aid of their fowling-pieces! Such a
night must surely be allowed to have had
its share of horrors. But heroic strength
of mind is the characteristic of the <i>European</i>
traders to <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>; and this alone
enabled the people of <i>Churchill</i> to escape
all the evils attendant on such a calamity.</p>
<p>Towards the evening of this day, the
<i>Prince of Wales</i> came to an anchor near us.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sept.</span> <i>2d</i>.&mdash;In the morning we weighed
anchor, and ran into the mouth of the
river, otherwise called <i>Five-fathom Hole</i>.
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
It is a very contracted anchorage, and at
high water there is not more than three
fathoms&rsquo; water on the bar. In running in
from <i>York Flats</i>, the large beacon must be
kept bearing <span class="small">S. W.</span> by <span class="small">W.</span> by compass. To
moor the ship, one anchor must be laid up
the stream, and another down it; and the
width of swinging room at low water does
not much exceed four times a ship&rsquo;s length;
having a dry muddy flat on the <span class="small">N. W.</span> and a
shoal to the <span class="small">S. E.</span> The water is perfectly
fresh, and fit for use, at the last quarter
ebb, and first quarter of the flood-tide.</p>
<p>As we lay at this anchorage until the
28th instant, I shall not notice each day
separately, but proceed to make such remarks
as occurred during our stay; contenting
myself with briefly stating, that the
<i>Prince of Wales</i> was employed during the
time in stowing away her cargo, &amp;c.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>The whole of the north-west part of the
continent of <i>America</i> is so completely intersected
with rivers and lakes, that <i>Mackenzie</i>
went the greater part of his journeys by
water. <i>York Factory</i> is situated on the bank
of a river, which has sometimes been called
<i>York River</i>; although it appears that the
majority agree in giving it the name of
<i>Hayes&rsquo; River</i>: but it undergoes many appellations
in its course from the <i>Echemamis</i> to
the sea. I shall therefore endeavour to
describe the river, by tracing a journey from
<i>York Factory</i> to <i>Lake Winnepeg</i>, a distance
of about five hundred miles: but the fur-traders
of <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i> are so well accustomed
to the route, that two men in a
slight bark canoe will undertake it without
the slightest hesitation.</p>
<p>On leaving <i>York Factory</i>, the boats proceed
against the stream, without meeting
any obstruction, up <i>Hayes&rsquo; River</i>, <i>Steel
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
River</i>, and forty miles of <i>Hill River</i>; when
they arrive at the first carrying-place, called
<i>Rock Portage</i>. The obstructions from henceforward
begin to augment; and at every
portage, the boat, with her whole cargo,
must be carried over land; which is rendered
sometimes extremely difficult, by the
ground being either rough or swampy.</p>
<p>After passing <i>Rock Portage</i>, the stream is
contracted; and there are a number of portages
intervening, before the boats can arrive
at a broad part of the stream, called
<i>Swampy Lake</i>, which contains a number of
small islands; and it may be considered as a
short half-way to <i>Lake Winnepeg</i>. Leaving
<i>Swampy Lake</i>, the stream is again contracted
into a narrow slip, called <i>Jack River</i>, in
which are four portages. On crossing these,
they enter a broader part, intersected by
innumerable small islands. This space is
styled the <i>Knee Lake</i>, and is sixty miles
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
in length. One of the small islands in the
centre of <i>Knee Lake</i> contains so great a
quantity of iron ore, as to cause the compass
to spin round with uncommon velocity.
At the upper end of the lake the stream
gradually lessens into another slip, called
<i>Trout River</i>, and here are four more portages:
then gently extending its boundaries,
the river opens on a wide expanse, called
<i>Holey Lake</i>, from some deep holes in the
bottom of it, and the great inequality of the
soundings throughout. At the eastern extremity
of this lake stands <i>Oxford House</i>,
the first trading port to be met with after
leaving the factory. Owing to the richness
of the soil, and the geniality of the climate,
this place produces a number of excellent
vegetables<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a>.</p>
<p>Proceeding onwards, the boats leave the
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
main body of <i>Holey Lake</i> to the left hand:
the stream then suddenly narrows; and after
passing four more carrying-places, the last
of which is called <i>Hill&rsquo;s Portage</i>, there is a
clear space, until a sudden serpentine bend
in the river forms the <i>White-fall</i>. The current
now begins to be very weak; and a
little farther on, they enter a narrow part
with still water. This spot is the highest
part of the land between <i>Lake Winnepeg</i>
and <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>; and <i>Hayes&rsquo; River</i> may,
perhaps, be said to take its rise about seven
miles to the southward of it, in a small lake
called <i>Winnepegosis</i>. The boats now meet
with a singular rock, which, from some
curious <i>Indian</i> paintings once found there,
has since been called the <i>Painted Stone</i>.
Over this rock the boat must be dragged,
and again launched on the opposite side,
into a long, narrow, boggy slip of water,
called the <i>Echemamis</i>. After emerging from
this strait, the current of the river begins to
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
operate in favour of the boats; and this
proves that the <i>Echemamis</i> is a small river,
taking its rise in the morasses about the
<i>Painted Stone</i>, and having no connection
with the river which leads from the <i>Painted
Stone</i> towards the sea. The <i>Echemamis</i> is,
however, lost at a short distance from its
source; as after the boats pass <i>Hairy Lake</i>,
the stream falls into the <i>Sea River</i>; and there
is a portage at their junction, called the <i>Sea
River</i> carrying-place. The <i>Sea River</i> is a
branch of the great <i>Nelson River</i>, separated
from the main stream at the <i>Play-green
Lake</i>, and rejoining it by a creek that opens
near <i>Hairy Lake</i>.</p>
<p>The boats go against the current up the
<i>Sea River</i>; and passing the little <i>Cross
Lake</i> and <i>Pike River</i>, they reach <i>Winnepeg</i>,
through the <i>Play-green Lake</i>. This last is
a wide body of water, covered with islands;
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
and may properly be said to be merely a
part of <i>Nelson River</i>, which holds its course
from the <i>Stony Mountains</i> to <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>.
The rough course from <i>York Factory</i> to
Lake <i>Winnepeg</i> is about south-west; but the
<i>Nelson River</i> makes a great angle between
<i>Winnepeg</i> and the sea; as it first runs off
<span class="small">N. N. E.</span>; and then takes its course, due
<span class="small">E. N. E.</span> to <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>, where it empties
itself by the side of <i>Hayes&rsquo; River</i><a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a>.</p>
<p>The labour of getting the boats up these
rivers is amazingly great: their crews encamp
on the banks every night; and they
generally land also to cook their meals,
except when they are compelled to subsist
on <i>pemmican</i>, a sort of dried, husky compound,
composed of pounded venison and
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
deer&rsquo;s fat mixed together. This species of
food is extremely nutritious: it requires no
cooking, and is sometimes rendered more
palatable by the addition of berries.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of wood growing
on the banks of the rivers, and indeed
the whole of the interior near the sea
is covered with it: but in the country
about Lake <i>Winnepeg</i> there are very few
trees, and the inhabitants are therefore
compelled to use the dung of the buffalo
for fuel. Both buffaloes and horses abound
in the open country. The woods on the
coast are principally composed of dwarf
poplars, larches, and all the varieties of the
pine species.</p>
<p>Having thus described the communication
by water between Lake <i>Winnepeg</i> and
<i>York Factory</i>, I shall conclude with a statement
of the respective distances.</p>

<p>It must be allowed, that the above is a
mere rough statement of an old trader, who
had been accustomed to traversing the route
for nearly twenty years.</p>
<p><i>Nelson River</i> is a much more noble stream
than <i>Hayes&rsquo; River</i>, with respect to its
navigation, extending about twenty miles
from the sea; but from thenceforward it
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
becomes so full of obstructions, from portages,
falls, and rapids, that the Company
have been compelled to establish their factory
upon, and give a decided preference to,
<i>Hayes&rsquo; River</i>, although they have an establishment
or two for trade on the former.
The <i>Nelson River</i> takes its rise, according
to <i>M<sup>c</sup>Kenzie</i>, in the <i>Stony Mountains</i>; and
empties itself into <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>, at the
same place as <i>Hayes&rsquo; River</i>. It is only
divided from the latter, at the mouth, by a
very low cape, called <i>Point of Marsh</i>, upon
which an exceeding high wooden beacon
has been erected by the Company, to enable
their ships to distinguish the mouth of the
river. The continual washing of the waters
on either side of the <i>Point of Marsh</i> has
enabled the sea to encroach a great deal on
the land, and thereby created many dangerous
shoals in the mouths of the rivers:
the navigation has, by these means, been
rendered extremely contracted and difficult.
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
The breaking up of the rivers in the
spring tends also, in a great measure, to increase
these evils: for, in the first place,
the ice being driven towards the sea
with an amazing velocity, it carries every
thing forcibly away, and causes a general
ruin upon the banks, by cutting down
large bodies of earth, and hurling trees
and rocks from their places. In the
second place, it frequently happens that
immense stones lying at the bottom of
the rivers become fixed into the ice during
the winter, and the freshes, in the spring,
consequently bear them away towards the
sea; but the ice not being able to sustain
their ponderous weight for any length of
time, it naturally occurs, that those masses
become disengaged, and are deposited at
the mouths of the rivers, where they
not only incommode the passages, but
likewise injure the ships&rsquo; cables by their
friction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>On the second day after our coming, an
<i>Indian</i> Chief arrived at the factory from
Lake <i>Winnepeg</i>, and some of our officers
brought him on board. He staid with us
two days; and as he was the Chief of one
of those tribes who still maintain a great
part of their primeval manners, <i>untainted</i>
by <i>European</i> civilization, a full description
of him may not be thought unentertaining.</p>
<p>This man had been brought from Lord
<i>Selkirk&rsquo;s</i> colony, at <i>Red River</i>, to <i>York Factory</i>,
by Captain <i>M<sup>c</sup>Donald</i>, the chief of
the colony. As far as I could collect, his
tribe are properly called the <i>Sotees</i>, or people
who go up and down the falls of rivers.
But they have been styled <i>Bongees</i> by the
<i>British</i>, from their being addicted to mendacity;
and as they are always crying out
&ldquo;<i>Bongee!</i>&rdquo; which, in their tongue, signifies
&ldquo;a little,&rdquo; perhaps, too, the colonists may
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
have thought the appellation peculiarly
adapted to the <i>Sotees</i>, as they are but a
weak tribe in point of numbers.</p>
<p>The Chief in question was about five feet
eight inches high, and, to all appearance,
about thirty years of age. It seems that he
had some claims to the territory on which
Lord <i>Selkirk&rsquo;s</i> colony now stands; but he
had sold his birth-right &ldquo;for a mess of pottage.&rdquo;
Therefore, to keep him in good
humour with the infant establishment, he
had been brought down on a visit to <i>York
Factory</i>, where it was intended that he
should receive an accumulation of honours.
A coat of coarse blue cloth, tawdrily ornamented
with tarnished lace, and adorned
with shoulder-knots; a round hat, with a
red ostrich feather in front; a very coarse
white shirt, with frill and ruffles; a pair of
red stockings, yellow garters, and black
shoes, were presented to him immediately
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
upon his arrival. If we add to all this finery,
his native ornaments, such as a neck-band
of wampum or bead-work<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a>, a long string
of beads suspended by his hair from each
temple, and a number of large metal links
of the coarsest workmanship, dangling from
either ear, his appearance will naturally
be imagined to have bordered upon the grotesque.
His thighs were entirely naked, as
he could not be prevailed upon to fetter
them with breeches; and the cartilage of
his nose had been perforated.</p>
<p>He appeared a very intelligent man, and
was highly delighted with every thing he
saw on board the ship. He was not particularly
pleased with any of our musical instruments,
except the drum. A sky-rocket
struck him quite dumb with astonishment;
and he afterwards observed to a person who
understood his language, &ldquo;That the
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
<i>Water-Governors</i><a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a> must be very powerful, who
could thus force the stars to fall from the
sky.&rdquo; Like most <i>Indians</i>, he was a great
egotist, and the general tenor of his conversation
ran upon his dignity. He observed
that he was a Governor, like ourselves; and
when the snow became deep on the ground,
his tribe were going out, under his command,
to make war upon the <i>Swee</i> Tribe;
and that after quitting his own territory, he
expected to meet his enemy in eight days.
He exulted that he had already killed two
of the <i>Swee</i> nation with his own hand; and
he gave us to understand, that his own
tribe always made war on horseback. We
presented him with a cutlass, at which he
was delighted, waving it above his head,
and boasting what wonders he should be
able to perform by its assistance. Upon
the whole, he was rather a swaggerer; but,
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
perhaps, this was a little excusable; because,
according to the character given of him by
those <i>Europeans</i> who had heard of his
fame, he had acquired an amazing influence
amongst many savage tribes, by his courage
and wisdom. Indeed, his remaining two
days with us, perfectly easy and contented,
is a proof that he possessed a good share of
the former quality; particularly as we were
all utter strangers to him, and he had neither
seen the sea nor a ship before in his
life: nor did he appear to be at all deficient
in the more tender susceptibilities of nature.
He had two wives, four sons, and six
daughters; and when I presented him with
a few spangles and beads, he gave me to
understand, that those trifles would be
received with great pleasure by his children,
on his return to his native country. It
surprised us much to observe with what
a degree of exactness he copied all our
methods of eating, drinking, &amp;c. As we
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
desired to hear him sing, we took advantage
of his imitative powers to make him comprehend
our wishes: accordingly, the person
who sat next to him began first, and the
song went regularly round the table, until
it reached the <i>Bongee</i> Chief; when, instantly
taking the hint, he rose up, and prefaced
his ditty with a long speech, which we of
course did not comprehend; but, by his
gestures, we could perceive that it was
evidently intended as an explanation of the
subject on which he was about to sing.
Then he suddenly struck off into an air
that gave us a much higher opinion of the
strength than the harmony of his voice.
The subject, we could perceive, was an
appeal to the Deity (<i>Manito</i>), to protect the
ship from all dangers, in her voyage across
the waters. We had many other songs
from him during the evening: and on a
special application, we were favoured with
a specimen of the war-whoop, a most
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
discordant howl, produced by striking the
hand quick against the mouth, and shouting
at the same time. But the most farcical
scene of all was the business of getting him
into a bed. The purser of the ship undertook
the difficult task of chambermaid; but
our <i>Indian</i> Chief disencumbered himself of
all his finery in a twinkling; and having
reduced himself to a state of nature, he
rolled head foremost into the bed, placing his
feet upon the pillow: this produced great
vexation in the mind of his <i>Abigail</i>, who
the next night succeeded, with much difficulty,
in causing his <i>Indian</i> Highness to lie
down like a <i>Christian</i>.</p>
<p>On the evening of the second day, our
<i>Indian</i> friend left us, to return back to his
native country. He seemed to feel great
regret at parting with the <i>Water-Governors</i>;
and he gave us all to understand, that
if we should hereafter visit his territories,
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
he would insure us a hearty welcome, and
a handsome bed-fellow to boot.</p>
<p>Captain <i>Stopford</i> having expressed a wish
to observe the manner of killing the reindeer,
as practised by the <i>Indians</i>, and a
party being accordingly made to ascend the
river, we left the factory early in the morning,
with a small boat of Captain <i>Stopford</i>&rsquo;s, and
a birch-bark canoe to carry the provisions,
tents, &amp;c. We continued to push along
shore, against the stream, until 10 <span class="small">A.M.</span>
when we rested at a small creek, called
<i>Dram-gat</i>, to breakfast. <i>Dram-gat</i> is about
seven miles from the factory: it abounds
with wild-duck; and receives its name from
an old custom of giving the people in the
traders&rsquo; boats a dram at this spot, previously
to proceeding farther on their journey
up the river. The tide of the sea ceases to
affect the current of the river entirely at the
<i>Dram-gat</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>We landed upon the bank, kindled a fire,
and roasted some venison-steaks after the
<i>Indian</i> manner, called by them <i>ponask</i>.
Having cut a long skewer of wood, they
scrape off the bark, and stick the meat upon
its point. The other end of the skewer is
then forced into the ground, close to the
fire; and by turning it round occasionally,
the food is soon sufficiently cooked. I
never tasted any thing more savoury than a
venison-steak prepared in this manner.
After making a hearty meal, we embarked
again; and two men taking out a line to the
beach, we were thus laboriously dragged
along shore. There are many islands and
shoals on the south side of the river; whilst
the northern shore is, generally speaking,
steep. The mouth of <i>Hayes&rsquo; River</i> is gradually
verging towards the north, in consequence
of the perceptible encroachments
of the water upon the north
bank, and the evident emerging of islands
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
and shoals towards the south side of the
river.</p>
<p>As we proceeded up the stream, we met
several canoes of <i>Indians</i>, deeply laden
with venison for the factory. After receiving
from us a small present of tobacco,
they continued their course.</p>
<p>At 3 <span class="small">P.M.</span> we had reached a large circular
island on the south side of the river, called
<i>Rainbow Island</i>. The view from this spot
was delightfully picturesque. The northern
shore was bounded with high clay banks,
covered with dark forests of the spruce-pine
tree. Above us, upon the southern
banks, five or six remarkable mounds of
earth rose majestically from the river. At
the termination of a long view upwards, the
stream was lost in a sudden bend to the
northward; and the vista in that direction
was bounded by a noble grove of poplars,
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">209</span>
that stood on the declivity of the green
sloping bank; and their bright yellow colour
formed a fine contrast with the sable hue
of a frowning forest in the back ground.
Directly opposite to the place where we
stood, several <i>Indian</i> canoes lay scattered
about the shore; and the natives sat regaling
themselves, around a blazing fire upon the
beach. The river, glittering with the golden
tints of the sun, ran smoothly beneath our
feet; and a little farther down, foamed, in
distant murmurs, over a shoal-bed of pebbles.
Whilst we stood contemplating the
varied objects in this interesting scene, a
flock of wild geese flew screaming past;
and a gentleman, who knew the country
well, immediately observed, that we should
have an &ldquo;<i>early fall</i>;&rdquo; thereby intimating
that the winter would soon make its appearance.
Our admiration of the fine view
before us instantly gave way to other
sensations; and we could not avoid wishing
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
ourselves speedily out of a country where
the transition is so instantaneous, from
the most oppressive heat to intense cold;
where the ground is bound up in frost
eight months of the year; and the miserable
inhabitants are tormented to madness by
heat and mosquitoes during the remaining
four.</p>
<p>Upon leaving <i>Rainbow Island</i>, we approached
the spiral mounds of earth before
mentioned. Their formation was so regular,
that an enthusiastic antiquary might
easily have believed them to be antient
<i>Indian</i> Tumuli; but upon a close inspection,
we plainly perceived that they had
been separated from the body of the bank by
the ices in the spring; and they had probably
assumed a circular form owing to the
washing of the great floods which follow
the breaking up of the rivers, and melting
of the snows, at that season of the year.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Interior of a Wigwam of the Cree Indians<br /><span class="small">London Published by J. Mawman 16.<sup>th</sup> May 1817</span></i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>About 5 <span class="small">P.M.</span> we reached a place called
<i>Poplar-fall</i>; and observing an <i>Indian</i> wigwam
on the north bank, we crossed the
river, and encamped within pistol-shot of it.
We had pitched our tent within the wood;
and from it we could discern the river, at
intervals, through the openings of the trees.
Although we were but a short distance
from the <i>Indian</i> wigwam, yet the wood
was so intricate, that we found it difficult
to find our way thither. We, however,
paid the natives a visit, and sat familiarly
down in the wigwam. It contained
one old and two young men, one old and
one young woman, and five or six children
of both sexes, besides two infants. The
wigwam was a circular tent, constructed
with three or four poles, lashed together at
the top, and covered over with an inferior
kind of leather, made of tanned deer-skins.
In the midst of the tent was a blazing fire;
and in the smoke above, a quantity of deer&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
flesh was suspended, after the manner of
bacon in <i>England</i>. On the outside of the
hut, there were several stages, on which
their strips of venison were exposed in the
sun to dry, for the winter&rsquo;s consumption.
After sitting a short time with the natives,
and inquiring at what part of the river the
rein-deer were crossing, we were at length
about to depart, when the old <i>Indian</i> presented
Captain <i>Stopford</i> with eight deers&rsquo;
legs, which, when roasted, are considered
a great delicacy, on account of the rich
marrow they contain. The young woman
then gave another of our party a deer&rsquo;s
heart and tongue; and the old squaw, whose
aspect was sufficient to give any man a dis-relish
to the whole sex, kindly tossed into my
lap a head and a brisket. Laden with these
presents, we returned to our tents, and
dined heartily off a tongue and heart, <i>ponasked</i>.
But our kind <i>Indian</i> neighbours
had not been so exceedingly munificent
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
without entertaining strong expectations of
an adequate remuneration: accordingly, the
visit was soon returned by the whole horde;
and the old <i>Indian</i> brought a kettle in his
hand, which was intended as a <i>gentle hint</i>
that he wished for a liquid equivalent. We
therefore gave him about a quart of rum,
mixed with three quarts of water, and a
trifling supply of tobacco. Extraordinary
as it may appear, this small donation was
amply sufficient to intoxicate every member
of the wigwam; and their voices resounded,
in song, through the woods, for many hours
after we had retired to rest.</p>
<p>Very shortly after the first dawn of day,
we were awakened by the old <i>Indian</i>: he
came to inform us, that several herd of deer
had already crossed the river, and that it was
high time we should repair to our stations,
to intercept any more which might attempt
to follow; as it is an ascertained fact, that
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
these animals, during their periodical journeys,
are accustomed to follow each other&rsquo;s
footsteps.</p>
<p>According to the old <i>Indian</i>&rsquo;s advice, we
proceeded about two miles farther up the
river, until we reached a place called
<i>Twenty-mile Island</i>; so named from its
distance from <i>York Factory</i>. Still pursuing
the directions of the friendly <i>Indian</i>, we
hauled our canoe close to the beach, on the
north side of the river; as, at this season of
the year, the rein-deer, in pursuance of
their northern journey, cross all the rivers
from the southward. The <i>Indian</i> proceeded
with his canoe higher up the stream,
and took his post opposite to the spot
from whence he had seen the before-mentioned
herds crossing in the morning:
he then concealed himself in the high
grass, by the side of his canoe; and we
also followed his example. After lying
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
thus in ambush for a short time, a small
herd, consisting of five deer and a fawn,
appeared on the south bank of the river,
exactly opposite the old <i>Indian</i>&rsquo;s canoe.
The timid and wary animals stood for some
time on the bank of the river, casting an
inquisitive glance across the water. We all
crouched closer than before, in the grass;
and we had soon the satisfaction to see the
whole herd leap boldly from the shore.
The <i>Indian</i> above us immediately pushed
across the stream with his canoe, to intercept
the retreat of the deer; and this he
was enabled to do unobserved, as he was
also a considerable distance above the deer;
and the animals neither looked to the right
nor to the left, but kept their eyes anxiously
fixed on the shore which they were endeavouring
to reach. As our lurking-place
was about half a mile lower down than the
place from whence the deer had taken to
the water, and the rapid current of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
river naturally drifted them downwards,
they would have attempted to land
close to us, had not a shoal in the river
arrested their progress, upon which they
mounted; and by their superior height they
immediately discovered us. The deer now
stood hesitating what they should do;
and so in fact did we: but our <i>Indian</i> co-adjutor
having by this time succeeded in
gaining the opposite shore, called loudly on
us to rise and advance. As soon as we
sprang from the grass, the affrighted herd
replunged into the river, and attempted to
gain the shore which they had quitted; but
we pursued them across the stream with
such activity, that only one effected its
landing, and the remaining four again turned
their heads to gain the northern bank. From
this moment their deaths were considered
inevitable, as the chief skill then lay in continually
turning the weary animals from
the shore, which we were easily enabled to
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
do, by the superior speed of our canoe. The
<i>Indian</i>, meanwhile, followed close behind a
large buck, until it approached the bank;
when he deliberately speared it in the
haunch; and as it emerged from the water,
he fired a bullet into its body: yet the
animal ran with speed into the wood, and
we all naturally concluded it must have
escaped;&mdash;but the skilful hunter smiled at
the idea: &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I have it
safe:&mdash;now for another;&rdquo; on which, he
wheeled about his canoe, and instantly
speared to death an amazing fine doe. My
gun being loaded with goose-shot only, I
discharged it into the rump of the surviving
doe, which bled profusely; I also again
fired, and struck it on the nose, when my
ramrod unfortunately fell overboard: however,
we still kept turning the animal from
the shore; and having now no weapon in
the canoe wherewith we could kill it, I was
obliged to halloo for the <i>Indian</i> to bring us a
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
spear; accordingly, he paddled towards the
deer with all his might, and, on reaching our
canoe, tossed me the spear. Following the
native&rsquo;s example, I made a deep thrust into
its haunch, which soon put an end to its
existence; and putting a cord over its head,
we towed it on shore in triumph.</p>
<p>As the <i>Indian</i> had predicted, he soon
found the carcase of the wounded buck,
lying about ten yards within the wood.
Thus we succeeded in obtaining <i>three</i> out
of the original <i>five</i>: and with respect to the
other two; one, as above-mentioned, made
good its escape in the first instance; and the
fawn also landed, whilst we were engaged
with the doe.</p>
<p>I have been more particular in relating
this expedition, because it will serve as a specimen
of the general manner in which the
<i>Indians</i> procure their supplies of venison
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
and deer-skins. There have been instances
of taking the rein-deer alive, by throwing
a rope about the antlers; but this can only
be attempted by a boat, as the sudden
plunges of the animal, when thus entangled,
is very likely to upset a slight bark canoe.</p>
<p>From the continual crossings that we had
made athwart the stream, whilst in pursuit
of the deer, the current had drifted us down
about two miles below our encampment,
which we did not regain until towards
evening; and our <i>Indian</i> neighbour soon
paid us a visit, to talk over the day&rsquo;s sport.
Having received another present of <i>Scutee
Wapper</i><a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a> (rum) and tobacco, he wished us a
good-night; and their songs shortly afterwards
began to swell on the air; giving to
us a sure indication of the liquor having
had its due effect on their senses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>To conclude my account of the rein-deer
of <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>, I must observe, that they
are evidently the same species with those of
<i>Lapland</i>; although the <i>Indians</i> have never
attempted to render them in any way useful
for domestic purposes: but Lord <i>Selkirk</i>,
with his usual perseverance, has procured
people from <i>Sweden</i> to train the rein-deer
in <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>; although they have not
yet been a sufficient time in the country
to ascertain the practicability of such a
scheme<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>If the <i>Indians</i> be so fortunate, during
their hunting journeys, as to kill a rein-deer
in the woods, they eat of it until they literally
cannot cram another mouthful. When
their meal is finished, they erect a high
stage, on which they lay the remainder of
the carcase, so as to secure it from the wild
beasts; and then cover it with branches of
trees, to defend it against the birds of prey.
All this trouble is taken, that the food
which they are compelled by necessity to
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
leave behind them may be of service to
some wandering tribe of hunters like themselves,
who may not have been so fortunate
as to have met with any deer in their
journey.</p>
<p>When, therefore, in traversing the immense
plains or forests of the interior, a
half-famished <i>Indian</i> descries at a distance
one of those charitable stages erected on
high for his relief, he hails the cheering
sight with the same feelings of delight that
is experienced by a tempest-tost and bewildered
sailor, when he descries, through
the dark clouds of a stormy night, the
cheering fire-beacon which denotes the
situation of a sheltering port. Whenever
an <i>Indian</i> has satisfied his hunger at one of
the stages in question, he marks the supporting
poles with the character peculiar to
his tribe; so that those to whom he is indebted
for relief may perceive, on their
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
return, whether their friends have benefitted
by their humane intentions. And it is a
singular point of honour amongst them,
that if, by the characters before mentioned,
they should discover that the stage
had been erected by an hostile tribe, they
will rather suffer the severest pangs of
hunger than be obliged to their enemy for
relief.</p>
<p>Upon our return to the factory from the
deer-hunt, we found much anxiety prevailing
respecting the safety of a small schooner,
which had sailed hence, on our arrival,
to bring the furs from <i>Churchill River</i>, and
had not yet returned. There was the more
foundation for such apprehensions, as it
blew a heavy gale on the day after her departure,
and she must consequently have been
overtaken by it before she could have possibly
reached her destined port. However,
it was determined to wait her return until
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
the 28th of <i>September</i>, when prudence dictated
our departure, to avoid the risk of a
detention for the whole winter. In the
mean time, we occupied our time in procuring
a stock of fresh provisions against
the day of sailing. Accordingly, a party of
<i>Indians</i> were despatched in pursuit of game;
and in a few days they returned with
eleven hundred wild geese, which they had
shot in the marshes to the southward of
<i>York</i>; and several other parties of the natives
poured in a copious supply of venison
and wild duck.</p>
<p>Nor were we idle ourselves, as we constantly
drew the <i>seine</i> in the mouth of the
river; but the supplies of fish thus obtained
were exceedingly trifling. Of those we
caught, the principal part consisted of
mullet, and <i>tittameg</i>, a small delicate fish
peculiar to the rivers of <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>Before I quit entirely this almost unknown
country, I shall insert an extract
from an author whose observations will
serve materially to illustrate my own<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The animals of <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i> are, the
moose-deer, stags, rein-deer, bears, wolves,
foxes, beavers, otters, lynxes, martens,
squirrels, ermines, wild-cats, and hares;
of the feathered kind, geese, bustards,
ducks, partridges, and all manner of wild
fowl: of fish, whales, morses, seals, cod,
sea-horses, and sea-unicorns: and in the
rivers and fresh waters, pike, perch,
carp, and trout. There have been taken
in one season, at <i>Nelson River</i>, 90,000
partridges, as large as hens; and 25,000
hares. Every thing changes white in
winter; even <i>European</i> animals after being
a short time in the country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;The inhabitants shew great ingenuity
in kindling a fire, in clothing themselves,
and in preserving their eyes: in other
respects, they are very savage<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a>. In their
shapes and faces they do not resemble
the <i>Indians</i>, who live to the south: they
are more like the <i>Laplanders</i> and <i>Samoeids</i>
of <i>Europe</i>, from whom they are probably
descended. Those on the sea-coast are
dexterous in managing their kiacks or
boats<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a>. The other <i>Americans</i> seem to be
of a <i>Tartar</i> original.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1670, a Charter was granted to a
Company, which does not consist of more
than nine or ten persons, for the exclusive
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">227</span>
trade to this Bay; and they have acted
under it ever since, with great benefit to
themselves. The fur and peltry trade
might be carried on to a much greater
extent, were it not entirely in the hands
of this exclusive Company; whose interested,
not to say inquisitive spirit, has
been the subject of long and just complaint.
The Company employ four ships,
and 130 seamen<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>French</i> destroyed the forts in 1782,
valued at 500,000<i>l.</i> The Company export
commodities to the amount of 16,000<i>l.</i>
and bring home returns to the value of
29,340<i>l.</i> which yield to the revenue 3,734<i>l.</i>
This includes the fishing in <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This commerce, small as it is, affords
great profits to the Company, and is
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">228</span>
advantageous to <i>Great Britain</i> in general;
for the commodities we exchange with
the <i>Indians</i>, for their skins and furs, are
all manufactured in <i>Great Britain</i>; and
as the <i>Indians</i> are not very nice in their
choice, those things are sent of which we
have the greatest plenty, and which, in
the mercantile phrase, are <i>drugs</i> with
us.&mdash;&mdash;Though the workmanship, too,
happens to be, in many respects, so deficient,
that no civilized people would
take it off our hands, it may nevertheless
be admired by the <i>Indians</i>. On the other
hand, the skins and furs we bring from
<i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i> enter largely into our manufactures,
and afford us materials for a
lucrative trade with many nations of
<i>Europe</i>. These circumstances tend to
prove incontestably the immense benefit
that would redound to <i>Great Britain</i> by
throwing open the trade to <i>Hudson&rsquo;s
Bay</i>; since, even in its present restrained
<span class="pb" id="Page_229">229</span>
state, it is so advantageous. The exclusive
Company, it is probable, do not find
commerce so advantageous now as it was
before we got possession of <i>Canada</i>. The
only attempt made to trade with <i>Labrador</i>
has been directed towards the fishery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the journeys of <i>M<sup>c</sup>Kenzie</i> and
<i>Hearne</i>, a complete confirmation has
arisen, that there can be no northern
communication between the <i>Atlantic</i> and
<i>Pacific Oceans</i>, except at so high a latitude
that it must be impeded by perpetual
ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mouth of the <i>Copper-mine River</i>,
as ascertained by Mr. <i>Hearne</i>, lies in latitude
72&deg; <span class="small">N.</span>; longitude, 119&deg; <span class="small">W.</span> of <i>Greenwich</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the <i>British</i> have had possession of
<i>Canada</i>, a strong competition has arisen
<span class="pb" id="Page_230">230</span>
between the people of that country and
the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i> traders. It is therefore
doubtful whether the opening of a free
trade into <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i> would be productive
of those very advantageous results
which Mr. <i>Pinkerton</i> has supposed: the
indefatigable <i>Canadians</i> have contrived to
carry their mercantile expeditions into
almost every part of the <span class="small">N. W.</span> continent
of <i>America</i>; and it can be of little
political consequence to the mother country,
whether the peltry trade is made to
pass through <i>Canada</i> or <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>;
except, indeed, that the opening of a free
intercourse with the Bay might operate
as a stimulus upon the <i>Esquimaux</i>, to animate
their exertions in the seal and whale
fisheries; as they would be then certain of
finding an adequate market for their oil,
whalebone, and seal-skins.</p>
<p>That nothing serves so effectually to
<span class="pb" id="Page_231">231</span>
deaden the spirit of mercantile application
as an unjust monopoly, is evident, from an
old record of the year 1742; which runs
thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When the <i>Indians</i> came to the factory
in <i>June</i> 1742, they could get but a pound
of gunpowder for four beaver skins, a
pound of shot for one beaver, an ell of
coarse cloth for fifteen, a blanket for
twelve, two fish-hooks or three flints for
one, a gun for twenty-five skins, a pistol
for ten, a hat with a white lace for seven,
an axe for four, a hedging-bill for one, a
gallon of brandy for four, a checked shirt
for seven; all which was sold at the
monstrous profit of 2000 per cent. Notwithstanding
which discouragement, the
<i>Indians</i> brought down to <i>Port Nelson</i>
that season 50,000 beaver skins, and 9000
martens; these beaver skins being worth
five or six shillings a pound; whereas
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">232</span>
those which the <i>English</i> purchase at <i>New
York</i> are not worth more than three shillings
and sixpence a pound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides these skins, the <i>Indians</i>, during
the same year (1742), brought to the factory,
at <i>Churchill</i>, 20,000 beaver skins.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the <i>Indians</i> were industrious at a
season when their labour was so miserably
repaid, they would consequently become,
at this moment, much more diligent;
because, owing to the competition
before noticed, they are certain of meeting
with something like an adequate return for
their commodities.</p>
<p>To this increased activity of the natives
is probably owing the late very visible diminution
in the staple article of their commerce,
the beaver skins; as it is evident
that those animals are becoming much more
<span class="pb" id="Page_233">233</span>
scarce, in consequence of the perseverance
with which their haunts are sought out and
invaded.</p>
<p>The 28th of <i>September</i> having at length
arrived, and the mercury in <i>Fahrenheit</i>&rsquo;s
thermometer having sunk to 20&deg;, we gave
up all hopes of the schooner returning from
<i>Churchill</i>; and came to the melancholy conclusion,
that she must have perished on
her voyage. We therefore weighed anchor
from <i>York River</i>, and steered our course
towards the north, with an intention of
touching, if possible, at the former place,
to seek information of the schooner, and
to get the furs from that factory; but a
brisk gale springing up from the <span class="small">N. W.</span>
which was immediately against us, we gave
up our design of visiting <i>Churchill</i>, and bore
away for <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Straits</i>. From henceforward
we had one continued gale in our
favour, until we reached the <i>Orkneys</i>, after
<span class="pb" id="Page_234">234</span>
an unparalleled quick voyage of nineteen
days. In passing through <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Straits</i>,
we could perceive none of the drift-ice or
<i>Esquimaux</i>, which were so plentiful in our
voyage outwards: the former had been
carried away to the ocean, by the prevalence
of the southerly currents; and the
latter had most probably retired to their
winter habitations.</p>
<p>We saw, however, many <i>icebergs</i> of
enormous magnitude in the <i>Straits</i>; but,
after leaving <i>Cape Resolution</i>, we reached
the <i>Orkneys</i> without noticing any more of
those dangerous islands<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a>.</p>
<p>We remained at the <i>Orkneys</i> nineteen
days before the other <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay</i> ship
arrived from thence; but she had experienced
<span class="pb" id="Page_235">235</span>
much bad weather, and made a
much longer passage than ourselves.</p>
<p>A few straggling remarks, made during
our stay at the <i>Orkneys</i>, will conclude this
Journal.</p>
<p>Entering <i>Stromness Harbour</i>, by the
<i>Hoy Passage</i>, the view on either hand is
extremely awful and sublime. <i>Hoy Head</i>
is a tremendous height; and it appears
doubly so from a ship sailing near to it, as
the western side of this craggy mountain
is nearly perpendicular; so much so, indeed,
that it obtained the appellation of
<i>Hoy Walls</i>. At a particular part of this
awful cliff, an immense rent has torn a
large fragment from the wall; and this
huge disjointed mass is now washed, on
all sides, by the most terrific breakers. It
stands however erect, repelling all their
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">236</span>
shocks; and it has assumed so completely
the human form, as to be styled the <i>Old
Man of Hoy</i>. This gigantic figure may be
about five hundred feet high.</p>
<p>If the lowness of the eastern shore gives
it a less grand appearance, yet the ledges
of sunken rocks, on which many a gallant
vessel has perished, together with the horrid
breakers roaring mountain high above
them, do not fail to inspire a spectator
with equal awe and terror.</p>
<p>The Cathedral of <i>St. Magnus</i>, at <i>Kirkwall</i>,
is built of a reddish kind of stone,
in the shape of a cross; and it looks, at a
short distance, much like a brick edifice.
It is of very large dimensions; and appears
to a stranger in a more imposing light,
because it is erected on an eminence. The
square tower issuing from the top of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_237">237</span>
cathedral, in the centre of the cross, was
formerly surmounted by a magnificent spire;
but being shattered some few years ago, by
lightning, a mean brick substitute has
since been erected. There is an amazing
number of windows; many of which have
been lately broken; and there are two
in the shape of a rose, exceedingly antique
and beautiful.</p>
<p>The doors of this structure are low and
arched, surrounded by a curious embroidery
of the same red stone as the rest
of the building. On entering the main
portal, the space not allotted to public
worship, the roof is supported by a double
row of enormous columns, eight on each
side: they are very simple and plain, composed
of square stones laid over each
other horizontally, and the shafts of the
pillars are of the same diameter from their
capitals to their bases. Owing to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">238</span>
moisture of the place, a green mould has
covered them, and given to the interior a
most venerable aspect.</p>
<p>Passing up the centre of the isle between
these aged pillars, we arrive at the centre
of the cross, where four immense fluted
columns support the spire, bells, and clock.
A boarded partition then runs across the
church; and a scrap of Scripture painted
over a door marks out the place of modern
worship. The interior of this part is neat,
and ornamented with some fine specimens
of carved oak, about two hundred years
old. Over many of the seats are antique
escutcheons of the former Earls of <i>Orkney</i>.
The one appertaining to Earl Patrick
Stuart, last Earl of <i>Orkney</i>, (who was
beheaded,) was quartered with lions and
ships, and inscribed thus:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">E <span class="hst">SIC &middot; FVIT &middot; EST &middot; ET &middot; ERIT</span></p>
<p class="t3">=</p>
<p class="t0">P : S</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>We had the curiosity to go up to the belfry,
by spiral staircases between the outer and
inner walls of the cathedral. The number
and intricacy of these dark passages was
really astonishing; and the darkness of the
place inspiring gloomy ideas, we fancied
that it was in such dismal recesses that the
bigotted monks used formerly to immure
their victims. There is one fine bell, and
two inferior ones, in the church, and a
noble clock by a <i>Scotch</i> mechanist. From
the belfry, a small door opens upon a rough ledge
about two feet wide: the view from
this dizzy height was extremely fine, as
the town of <i>Kirkwall</i>, the adjacent islands,
and numerous lochs, appear to lie in a
panoramic view beneath the feet: but
we were truly glad to re-enter the belfry,
as the want of security on the ledge quite
destroyed the pleasure arising from so fine
a prospect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>On leaving the Cathedral of <i>St. Magnus</i>,
we stepped aside, between the enormous circular
columns before mentioned, to observe
the only sepulchral arch of any antique appearance
in the place. There was a shield
sculptured at the apex, bearing three <i>hearts</i>
as a device; from which we conjectured that
it must have received the ashes of a <i>Douglas</i>&mdash;the
<i>heart</i> having been the device of
this family ever since the heart of the far-famed
<i>Bruce</i> was conveyed, by that king&rsquo;s
desire, to the <i>Holy Land</i>, by an Earl
<i>Douglas</i><a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a>.</p>
<p>This noble cathedral is said to have been
built in the year 1200, and is in an excellent
state of preservation.</p>
<p>On the right of <i>St. Magnus</i> stand the
ruins of the palaces formerly inhabited by
<span class="pb" id="Page_241">241</span>
the Earls and Bishops of <i>Orkney</i>. The
cathedral and palace are within a stone&rsquo;s
throw of each other; but the latter stands
on each side of a space which appears to
have been the former court-yard of the
building. The entrance to this court-yard is
by a low arched gateway. The palace of
the Earls is in better preservation than the
cathedral; and it is to be regretted, that the
dilapidations to which it is exposed are
suffered to take place.</p>
<p>The corners of the Earl&rsquo;s palace are
laden with immense turrets, which give
the building a very heavy appearance.
The main portal is a massy low doorway;
and the ascent to the great hall
is by a fine broad flight of stone steps.
Within the hall are two arched fire-places,
each sufficiently capacious to roast
a whole ox at a time. One of the fire-places
is formed beneath an arch constructed in
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">242</span>
the usual way; but the other is considered
as a curiosity in architecture: it is a plane
arch, supported by the transverse joining
of the stones without the aid of cement.
The windows of the hall are high and arched,
but without either frame-work or glass.</p>
<p>The Bishop&rsquo;s palace is now nearly destroyed;
and, from the unceasing attacks
made upon it, will soon be entirely so.</p>
<p>It is difficult to ascertain the original shape
of this venerable structure; there being but
two walls now remaining. At the end of one
of these walls is a circular tower, of great
strength and solidity, which, probably, was
intended for the defence of the palace. Although
the Earl and the Bishop had their
residences so near to each other, yet the temporal
and ecclesiastical Chiefs were ever at
variance, and their quarrels and intrigues occupy
a large portion of the <i>Orkney</i> history.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>The town of <i>Kirkwall</i> consists of one
long narrow street, which, from its proximity
to the sea, and its central situation,
was chosen to be the metropolis of the
<i>Orkneys</i> many years ago: it is now a royal
burgh, and it sends one member to Parliament.
The street is generally damp and
muddy, and there are very few good-looking
houses in it. The house of a gentleman
of the name of <i>Baikie</i> has five or six
trees growing before it; and these are, I
believe, almost the only trees in <i>Orkney</i>;
although it be proved, from the number of
roots dug up occasionally, that the <i>Orkneys</i>,
in former times, were by no means destitute
of wood<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a>.</p>
<p>The town is badly lighted; but, in this
respect, it is superior to <i>Stromness</i>; which
<span class="pb" id="Page_244">244</span>
place cannot boast of a single lamp.
When we mentioned this inconvenience,
during a conversation with one of the
magistrates, he most ingeniously parried
the attack, by asserting that the inhabitants
were all so sober and good, that they
never quitted their houses after dark; consequently
the lighting of the town would
be attended with <i>unnecessary</i> expense and
trouble.</p>
<p>The people of <i>Kirkwall</i> boast much of
the <i>Ayr</i>, a public promenade belonging to
the town. The <i>Ayr</i> is a natural embankment,
projecting like a pier into the sea,
and it is washed on both sides by the water.
In summer time, the <i>Ayr</i> must prove a
very refreshing walk, and an agreeable
escape from the filthy street of <i>Kirkwall</i>.</p>
<p>With regard to the people of <i>Orkney</i>, it
will be only necessary to add, that a most
<span class="pb" id="Page_245">245</span>
unbounded hospitality is their leading characteristic;
and perhaps an eager curiosity
is also an equally prominent trait. When
a stranger enters the town of <i>Kirkwall</i>, the
intelligence of his arrival flies with the rapidity
of wild-fire: the old women, with
their knitting apparatus in their hands,
stand staring at the doors; and they hardly
suffer him to pass, before his ears are
assailed by a general inquiry of &ldquo;<i>D&rsquo;ye ken
wha that chiel is?</i>&rdquo; This exclamation is
repeated by a dozen voices at once, at every
door he passes in his route; and he will
perhaps feel uneasy in thus becoming an
object of scrutiny to the whole population.</p>
<p>The people of <i>Orkney</i> are naturally
grave and sober, with much outward appearance
of devotion; yet, at the annual
fair which is held at <i>Kirkwall</i>, they suddenly
relax into the most unbridled licentiousness:
neither are they in general to be
<span class="pb" id="Page_246">246</span>
admired for the honour or liberality of
their dealings, as they delight in making
what is called a &ldquo;<i>gude bargain</i>;&rdquo; and
they feel no hesitation in overcharging a
stranger, to accomplish this desirable end.</p>
<p>I shall here conclude this Narrative;
merely adding, that the <i>Rosamond</i> and her
convoy again sailed from the <i>Orkneys</i> on the
7th of <i>November</i>, and arrived safe at the <i>Nore</i>
on the 17th of the same month; when an
inspection having been made of the <i>Rosamond</i>&rsquo;s
defects, she was reported to be
totally unfit for sea, in consequence of the
damage she had sustained amongst the ice
of <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Straits</i>; and she was accordingly
put out of commission, and immediately
advertised to be sold out of His
Majesty&rsquo;s service.</p>

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_2" href="#fr_2">[2]</a>This duty is considered by all naval officers as the severest
trial of health and spirit to which the profession of a seaman
is liable: and in proof of this, it will appear, by the following
Narrative, that, upon the <i>Rosamond</i> being ordered a second
time to this station, her Captain obtained leave to quit his
ship, and eight of her crew deserted the first time the boat
went to shore, after the order arrived from the <i>Admiralty</i>.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_3" href="#fr_3">[3]</a>See the narrative of this circumstance, as it appeared,
at the time, in the <i>Naval Chronicle</i> and other public journals.
Upon this signal instance of <i>British</i> valour in a person so
young as to be almost a child in the service, and who had
gallantly volunteered to accompany the expedition upon this
dangerous enterprise, the Captain of his ship presented Mr.
<i>Chappell</i> with the sword of the <i>Spanish</i> Commander, as the
prize of his valour.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_4" href="#fr_4">[4]</a>The Gunner was tried by a Court-martial, during our
stay at the <i>Nore</i>; and was sentenced, to be reprimanded,
and to receive an admonition to be more cautious in future.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_5" href="#fr_5">[5]</a>This is one of the most remarkable examples of the

to the northward, used kettles made of <i>lapis ollaris</i>.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_12" href="#fr_12">[12]</a>It was probably <i>Sea-weed</i>; a kind of food eaten as a stew, or

of <i>Esquimaux</i> manufacture which were presented, by the
Author, to the University Library at <i>Cambridge</i>; accompanied,
also, by a List of things of a similar nature brought to
<i>Russia</i> by Commodore <i>Billings</i>, from the <span class="small">N. W.</span> coast of <i>America</i>.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_14" href="#fr_14">[14]</a>This gallant officer lost his arm in the attack on <i>Java</i>, by
a cannon-ball. The seamen seeing him knocked backwards by
the shock, and lying senseless, conjectured that he had been
killed outright; but as they were bearing him off the field, the
Captain recovered his senses, and feeling the hot beams of a
vertical sun striking directly on his face and head (his hat
having rolled off when he fell), he immediately exclaimed to
one of his men, &ldquo;<i>Damme, Sir! fetch me my hat.</i>&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_15" href="#fr_15">[15]</a>Some of the arrows brought to <i>England</i> by the Author were

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_18" href="#fr_18">[18]</a>This practice was common to almost all the antient
world; especially to the <i>Celtic</i> and <i>Gothic</i> tribes, as manifested
by the antiquities now found in their sepulchres. Possibly,
therefore, the <i>Asiatic</i> origin of the <i>Esquimaux</i> may
hence be deduced. The same custom also exists among the
<i>Greenlanders</i>; who are, in fact, a branch of the <i>Esquimaux</i>.
&ldquo;They like,&rdquo; says <i>Crantz</i>, &ldquo;to make the grave in some
remote high place, laying a little moss upon the bare ground
(for the rock admits of no digging), and spread a skin upon
it. . . . . Near the burying spot they deposit the <i>kajak</i> and
darts of the deceased, and the tools he daily used.&rdquo;&mdash;See

Lord <i>Selkirk</i>, in conjunction with the <i>Hudson&rsquo;s-Bay Company</i>,
on the River <i>Asnaboyne</i>, in the interior of the <span class="small">N. W.</span>
Continent of <i>America</i>. Disputes with the <i>Metiffs</i> of the
Country, a race of people between <i>Canadians</i> and <i>Indians</i>,
inflamed the natural jealousy which the latter have always
felt, relative to the agricultural encroachments on their
hunting-grounds in the interior, and, we understand, compelled
his Lordship&rsquo;s Governor to abandon the establishment
which had been made.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;About one hundred and
forty settlers were conveyed by the <i>Canadian</i> traders to
Lake <i>Superior</i>, on their way to <i>Canada</i>; and the remainder
are supposed to have gone to <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i>, with a view of
finding a passage to <i>Great Britain</i>.</div><div class="fncont">&ldquo;The Governor, Mr. <i>M<sup>c</sup>Donald</i>, and a Sheriff, also appointed
by Lord <i>Selkirk</i> (Mr. <i>Spencer</i>), were brought down
prisoners to <i>Montreal</i>; the one for having granted,
the other for having executed, a warrant, under the
authority of which, provisions, the property of <i>Canadian</i>
traders, were seized during the preceding winter, for the
maintenance of the colonists; and these gentlemen were
admitted to bail in the Courts of <i>Lower Canada</i>, to take
their trials for this alleged offence.&rdquo;</div><div class="fncont">Whatever may be the decision of the Judges on this trial,
the <i>Metiffs</i> will have succeeded in their malevolent intention,
that of destroying all prospect of the Colony ever arriving to
a flourishing condition.

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_39" href="#fr_39">[39]</a>Here Mr. <i>Pinkerton</i>, although perfectly correct in every
other respect, has fallen into the same error as other geographers;
namely, in peopling <i>Hudson&rsquo;s Bay</i> with <i>Esquimaux</i>:
whereas, the <i>Cree Indians</i>, who inhabit the Bay, are not
savage, take no care of their eyes, and are clothed by the
<i>European</i> traders.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_40" href="#fr_40">[40]</a>Here he plainly alludes to the <i>Esquimaux</i> of <i>Hudson&rsquo;s

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
